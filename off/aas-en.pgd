Consciousness	^ck#aas1^z1(A Manual of Abhidhamma) ^z2(Compendium of Consciousness)^n1^z3(Words of Praise) Having respectfully saluted the Fully Enlightened One, the Peerless One, along with the Sublime Teaching and the Noble Order,
 I will recite the Manual of Abhidhamma — a compendium of the things contained in the Abhidhamma.
^z3(The Fourfold Ultimate Reality)^n2 ^n102 The things contained in the Abhidhamma, spoken of therein, are altogether fourfold from the standpoint of ultimate reality:
 consciousness (citta), mental factors (cetasika), matter (rūpa), and Nibbāna.
^bb#103^z3( Four Classes of Consciousness)^n103 Of them, consciousness (citta), firstly, is fourfold: (1) sense-sphere consciousness (kāmāvacara);
 (2) fine-material-sphere consciousness (rūpāvacara);
 (3) immaterial- sphere consciousness (arūpāvacara);
 and (4) supramundane consciousness (lokuttara).
Sense-Sphere Consciousness	^bb#104^z4(Sense-Sphere Consciousness)^z5(Unwholesome Consciousness)^z6(Consciousness Rooted in Greed)^n104 Amongst them, what pertains to the sense sphere?
1. One consciousness, accompanied by joy, associated with wrong view, unprompted.
2. One consciousness, accompanied by joy, associated with wrong view, prompted.
3. One consciousness, accompanied by joy, dissociated from wrong view, unprompted.
4. One consciousness, accompanied by joy, dissociated from wrong view, prompted.
5. One consciousness, accompanied by equanimity, associated with wrong view, unprompted. 
6. One consciousness, accompanied by equanimity, associated with wrong view, prompted. 
7. One consciousness, accompanied by equanimity, dissociated from wrong view, unprompted. 
8. One consciousness, accompanied by equanimity, dissociated from wrong view, prompted. 
These eight types of consciousness are accompanied by greed. 
^bb#105^z6(Consciousness rooted in hatred)^n105 9. One consciousness, accompanied by displeasure, associated with aversion, unprompted. 
10. One consciousness, accompanied by displeasure, associated with aversion, prompted.
These two types of consciousness are associated with aversion. 
^bb#106 ^z6(Consciousness Rooted in Delusion)^n106 11. One consciousness, accompanied by equanimity, associated with doubt.
12. One consciousness, accompanied by equanimity, associated with restlessness.
These two types of consciousness involve sheer delusion. 
^bb#107^n107 Thus end, in all, the twelve types of unwholesome consciousness. 
^h(Summary of Unwholesome Consciousness) ^n108 ^i(Eight are rooted in greed, two in hatred, and two in delusion.)
 ^i(Thus, there are twelve types of unwholesome consciousness.) 
Rootless Consciousness	^bb#108 ^z5(Rootless Consciousness)^z6(Unwholesome Resultant Consciousness)^n109 1. Eye-consciousness accompanied by equanimity; as are
2. ^i(Ear-consciousness;)
3. ^i(Nose-consciousness;)
4. ^i(Tongue-consciousness;)
5. Body-consciousness accompanied by pain; 
6. Receiving consciousness accompanied by equanimity; 
7. Investigating consciousness accompanied by equanimity.
These seven are the unwholesome resultant types of consciousness. 
^bb#109 ^z6(Wholesome-Resultant Rootless Consciousness) ^n110 8. Eye-consciousness accompanied by equanimity; as are
9. ^i(Ear-consciousness;)
10. ^i(Nose-consciousness;)
11. ^i(Tongue-consciousness;)
12. Body-consciousness accompanied by pleasure;
13. Receiving consciousness accompanied by equanimity; 
14. Investigating consciousness accompanied by joy;
15. Investigating consciousness accompanied by equanimity.
These eight are the wholesome-resultant types of rootless consciousness. 
^bb#110 ^z6(Rootless Functional Consciousness) ^n111 16. Five-sense-door adverting consciousness accompanied by equanimity; as is
17. Mind-door adverting consciousness;
18. Smile-producing consciousness accompanied by joy.
These three are the rootless functional types of consciousness.
^h(Summary of Rootless Consciousness) ^n112  Thus end, in all, the eighteen types of rootless consciousness.
^n113 Seven are unwholesome-resultants. Wholesome-resultants are eightfold.
 Three are functionals. Thus, the rootless are eighteen.
Beautiful Consciousness	^bb#112 ^z5(Beautiful Consciousness) ^n114 Excluding those that are evil and the rootless, the rest are called “beautiful.”
 They number either fifty-nine or ninety-one.
^bb#113^n115^z6(Sense-Sphere Beautiful Consciousness)^z7(Sense-Sphere Wholesome Consciouness) 1. One consciousness, accompanied by joy, associated with knowledge, unprompted.
2. One consciousness, accompanied by joy, associated with knowledge, prompted.
3. One consciousness, accompanied by joy, dissociated from knowledge, unprompted.
4. One consciousness, accompanied by joy, dissociated from knowledge, prompted.
5. One consciousness, accompanied by equanimity, associated with knowledge, unprompted. 
6. One consciousness, accompanied by equanimity, associated with knowledge, prompted. 
7. One consciousness, accompanied by equanimity, dissociated from knowledge, unprompted. 
8. One consciousness, accompanied by equanimity, dissociated from knowledge, prompted. 
These are the eight types of sense-sphere wholesome consciousness with roots. 
^bb#114 ^z7(Sense-Sphere Resultant Consciousness) ^n116 9. One consciousness, accompanied by joy, associated with knowledge, unprompted.
10. One consciousness, accompanied by joy, associated with knowledge, prompted.
11. One consciousness, accompanied by joy, dissociated from knowledge, unprompted.
12. One consciousness, accompanied by joy, dissociated from knowledge, prompted.

14. One consciousness, accompanied by equanimity, associated with knowledge, prompted. 
15. One consciousness, accompanied by equanimity, dissociated from knowledge, unprompted. 
16. One consciousness, accompanied by equanimity, dissociated from knowledge, prompted. 
These are the eight types of sense-sphere resultant consciousness with roots. 
^bb#115^z7(Sense-Sphere Functional Consciousness) ^n117 17. One consciousness, accompanied by joy, associated with knowledge, unprompted.
18. One consciousness, accompanied by joy, associated with knowledge, prompted.
19. One consciousness, accompanied by joy, dissociated from knowledge, unprompted.
20. One consciousness, accompanied by joy, dissociated from knowledge, prompted.
21. One consciousness, accompanied by equanimity, associated with knowledge, unprompted. 
22. One consciousness, accompanied by equanimity, associated with knowledge, prompted. 
23. One consciousness, accompanied by equanimity, dissociated from knowledge, unprompted. 
24. One consciousness, accompanied by equanimity, dissociated from knowledge, prompted. 
These are the eight types of sense-sphere functional consciousness with roots.
^n118 Thus end, in all, the twenty-four types of sense-sphere consciousness with roots — wholesome, resultant, and functional. 
^bb#116 ^z6(Summary of Sense-Sphere Beautiful Consciousness )^n119 The sense-sphere consciousness with roots (sahetu) — understood as wholesome, resultant, and functional —
 becomes twenty-four by classification according to feeling (vedanā), knowledge (ñāṇa), and prompting (saṁkhāra). 
^bb#117 ^z5(Summary of Sense-Sphere Consciousness)^n120 In the sense-sphere, twenty-three 〔cittas〕 are resultant, twenty are wholesome and unwholesome,
 and eleven are functional. Thus, there are altogether fifty-four 〔cittas〕.
Fine-Material-Sphere Consciousness	^bb#118 ^z4(Fine-Material-Sphere Consciousness)^z5(Fine-Material-Sphere Wholesome Consciousness) ^n121 1. First jhāna wholesome consciousness together with initial application, sustained application, zest, happiness, and one-pointedness.
2. Second jhāna wholesome consciousness together with sustained application, zest, happiness, and one-pointedness.
3. Third jhāna wholesome consciousness together with zest, happiness, and one- pointedness. 
4. Fourth jhāna wholesome consciousness together with happiness and one-pointedness.
5. Fifth jhāna wholesome consciousness together with equanimity and one-pointedness.
These are the five types of fine-material-sphere wholesome consciousness. 
^bb#119 ^z5(Fine-Material-Sphere Resultant Consciousness) ^n122 1. First jhāna resultant consciousness together with initial application, sustained application, zest, happiness, and one-pointedness.
2. Second jhāna resultant consciousness together with sustained application, zest, happiness, and one-pointedness.
3. Third jhāna resultant consciousness together with zest, happiness, and one- pointedness. 
4. Fourth jhāna resultant consciousness together with happiness and one-pointedness.
5. Fifth jhāna resultant consciousness together with equanimity and one-pointedness.
These are the five types of fine-material-sphere resultant consciousness. 
^bb#120 ^z5(Fine-Material-Sphere Functional Consciousness) ^n123 1. First jhāna functional consciousness together with initial application, sustained application, zest, happiness, and one-pointedness.
2. Second jhāna functional consciousness together with sustained application, zest, happiness, and one-pointedness.
3. Third jhāna functional consciousness together with zest, happiness, and one- pointedness. 
4. Fourth jhāna functional consciousness together with happiness and one-pointedness.
5. Fifth jhāna functional consciousness together with equanimity and one-pointedness.
These are the five types of fine-material-sphere functional consciousness. 
^n124 Thus end, in all, the fifteen types of fine-material-sphere wholesome, resultant, and functional consciousness. 
^bb#121^z5( Summary of Fine-Material Consciousness)^n125 Fine-material-sphere consciousness is fivefold when divided by way of the jhānas.
 It becomes fifteen types when (further) divided by way of the wholesome, resultant, and functional.
Immaterial-Sphere Consciousness	^bb#122^z4(Immaterial-Sphere Consciousness)^z5(Immaterial-Sphere Wholesome Consciousness)^n126 1. Wholesome consciousness pertaining to the base of infinite space.
2. Wholesome consciousness pertaining to the base of infinite consciousness.
3. Wholesome consciousness pertaining to the base of nothingness.
4. Wholesome consciousness pertaining to the base of neither perception nor non- perception. 
These are the four types of immaterial-sphere wholesome consciousness. 
^bb#123^z5(Immaterial-Sphere Resultant Consciousness)^n127 5. Resultant consciousness pertaining to the base of infinite space.
6. Resultant consciousness pertaining to the base of infinite consciousness.
7. Resultant consciousness pertaining to the base of nothingness.
8. Resultant consciousness pertaining to the base of neither perception nor non- perception. 
These are the four types of immaterial-sphere resultant consciousness. 
^bb#124^z5( Immaterial-Sphere Functional Consciousness)^n128 9. Functional consciousness pertaining to the base of infinite space.
10. Functional consciousness pertaining to the base of infinite consciousness.
11. Functional consciousness pertaining to the base of nothingness.
12. Functional consciousness pertaining to the base of neither perception nor non- perception. 
These are the four types of immaterial-sphere functional consciousness. 
^n129 Thus end, in all, the twelve types of immaterial-sphere wholesome, resultant, and functional consciousness. 
^bb#125^z4(Summary of Immaterial-Sphere Consciousness )^n130 Immaterial-sphere consciousness is fourfold when classified by way of object.
 When again divided by way of the wholesome, resultant, and the functional, it stands at twelve types. 
Supramundane Consciousness	^bb#126^z4(Supramundane Consciousness)^z5(Supramundane Wholesome Consciousness) ^n131 Path consciousness of stream-entry.
2. Path consciousness of once-returning. 
3. Path consciousness of non-returning. 
4. Path consciousness of Arahantship.
These are the four types of supramundane wholesome consciousness. 
^bb#127^z5(Supramundane Resultant Consciousness) ^n132 5. Fruition consciousness of stream-entry.
6. Fruition consciousness of once-returning.
7. Fruition consciousness of non-returning.
8. Fruition consciousness of Arahantship.
These are the four types of supramundane resultant consciousness. 
^n133 Thus end, in all, the eight types of supramundane wholesome and resultant consciousness. 
^bb#128^z4(Summary of Supramundane Consciousness) ^n134 The wholesome consciousness is fourfold, divided by way of the four paths.
 So too are the resultants, being their fruits. Thus, the supramundane should be understood as eightfold.
Summary of Consciousness	^bb#129^z3(Comprehensive Summary of Consciousness ) ^n135 Thus, there are twelve unwholesome types of consciousness and twenty-one wholesome types.
 Resultants are thirty-six in number, and functional types of conscious- ness are twenty.
^n136 There are fifty-four sense-sphere types of consciousness and fifteen assigned to the fine-material sphere.
 There are twelve types of consciousness in the immaterial sphere and eight that are supramundane.
^bb#130^z4(121 Consciousness)^z5(In Brief)^n137 These different classes of consciousness,
 which thus number eighty-nine, are divided by the wise into one hundred twenty-one.
^bb#131^z5(In Detail) ^n138 How does consciousness that is analyzed into eighty-nine types become one hundred twenty-one types? 
1. The first jhāna path consciousness of stream-entry together with initial application, sustained application, zest, happiness, and one-pointedness.
2. The second jhāna path consciousness of stream-entry together with sustained application, zest, happiness, and one-pointedness.
3. The third jhāna path consciousness of stream-entry together with zest, happiness, and one-pointedness. 
4. The fourth jhāna path consciousness of stream-entry together with happiness and one-pointedness. 
5. The fifth jhāna path consciousness of stream-entry together with equanimity and one- pointedness. 
These are the five types of path consciousness of stream-entry.
^n139 So too for the path consciousness of once-returning, of non-returning, and of Arahantship, making twenty types of path consciousness.
^n140 Similarly, there are twenty types of fruition consciousness. Thus, there are forty types of supramundane consciousness.
^bb#132^z3(Concluding Summary ) ^n141 Dividing each (supramundane) consciousness into five kinds according to different jhāna factors,
 the supramundane consciousness, it is said, becomes forty.
^n142 As the fine-material-sphere consciousness is treated by division into first jhāna consciousness and so on,
 even so is the supramundane consciousness. The immaterial- sphere consciousness is included in the fifth jhāna.
Thus, the jhānas beginning from the first amount to eleven, they say.
 The last jhāna (that is, the fifth) totals twenty-three.
^n143^n200 Thirty-seven are wholesome, fifty-two are resultants;
 thus, the wise say that there are one hundred twenty-one types of consciousness.
Thus ends the first chapter
in the Manual of Abhidhamma entitled “The Compendium of Consciousness.”
Mental Factors	^ck#aas2^z1(Compendium of Mental Factors ) ^bb#201 ^z2(Introduction)^n201 The fifty-two states associated with consciousness, which arise and cease together (with consciousness)
 and which have the same object and base (as consciousness), are known as “mental factors” (cetasika).
^bb#202^z2(52 Mental Factors)^z3(Ethically variable)^z4(The Universals)^n202 How? I. (1) Contact, (2) feeling, (3) perception, (4) volition, (5) one-pointed- ness, (6) mental life faculty, and (7) attention —
 these seven mental factors are termed “universals,” that is, common to every consciousness.
^bb#203^z4(The Occasionals)^n203 II. (1) Initial application, (2) sustained application, (3) decision, (4) energy, (5) bliss, and (6) desire —
 these six mental factors are termed “occasionals.”
^n204 Thus, these thirteen mental factors should be understood as the ethically variable factors.
Unwholesome Mental Factors	^bb#204^z3(The Unwholesome Factors)^n205 III. (1) Delusion, (2) shamelessness, (3) fearlessness of wrong-doing, (4) restlessness, (5) greed, (6) wrong view, (7) conceit,
 (8) hatred, (9) envy, (10) avarice, (11) worry, (12) sloth, (13) torpor, and (14) doubt
 — these fourteen mental factors are termed “the unwholesome.”
Beautiful Mental Factors	^bb#205^z3(The Universal Beautiful Factors)^n206 IV.  (1) Faith, (2) mindfulness, (3) shame, (4) fear of wrongdoing, (5) non-greed, (6) non-hatred, (7) neutrality of mind,
 (8) tranquility of the (mental) body, (9) tranquility of consciousness, (10) lightness of the (mental) body, (11) lightness of consciousness, (12) malleability of the (mental) body, (13) malleability of consciousness,
 (14) wieldiness of the (mental) body, (15) wieldiness of consciousness, (16) proficiency of the (mental) body, (17) proficiency of consciousness, (18) rectitude of the (mental) body, and (19) rectitude of consciousness
 — these nineteen mental factors are termed “the universal beautiful factors.”
^bb#206^z4(The Abstinences) ^n207 V. (1) Right speech, (2) right action, and (3) right livelihood — these three are termed “abstinences.”
^bb#207^z4(The Illimitables) ^n208 VI. (1) Compassion, (2) appreciative joy — these are termed “illimitables.”
^bb#208^z4(Non-delusion) VII. Together with the faculty of wisdom (paññā), these twenty-five, in all, are to be understood as beautiful mental factors.
^bb#209^z3(Summary) ^n209 Thus: 
 Thirteen are ethically variable, and fourteen are unwholesome.
 Twenty-five are beautiful. Thus, fifty-two have been enumerated.
Analysis Mental Factors	^bb#210^z3(Association of Mental Factors) Introductory Verse ^n210 In the following, we will explain, in the appropriate ways,
 the association of each of these mental adjuncts with the different states of consciousness.
^n211 Seven are linked with every type of consciousness. The occasionals are linked in the appropriate ways.
 Fourteen are linked only with the unwholesome types, and the beautiful factors only with the beautiful types (of consciousness).
^bb#211^z4(The Ethically Variable Factors) Analysis  ^n212 ^i(In what way?) 1. In the first place, the seven universal mental factors are found in all the eighty-nine types of consciousness.
^n213 ^b(Among the particular mental factors:) 2. Initial application arises in fifty-five types of consciousness: in all types of sense- sphere consciousness except the two sets of fivefold sense consciousness (54 – 10= 44); and also in the eleven types of first jhāna consciousness (44 + 11 = 55).
^n214 3. Sustained application arises in sixty-six types of consciousness: in those fifty-five and in the eleven types of second jhāna consciousness (55 + 11 = 66).
^n215 4. Decision arises in all types of consciousness excluding the two sets of fivefold sense consciousness and consciousness accompanied by doubt (89 – 11 = 78).
^n216 5. Energy arises in all types of consciousness excluding the five-sense-door adverting consciousness, the two sets of fivefold sense consciousness, receiving consciousness, and investigating consciousness (89 – 16 = 73).
^n217 6. Zest arises in all types of consciousness excluding those accompanied by displeasure and equanimity, body-consciousness, and the fourth jhāna consciousness (121 – 〔2 + 55 +2 + 11〕 = 51).
^n218 7. Desire arises in all types of consciousness excluding the rootless and the two types of consciousness accompanied by delusion (89 – 20 = 69).
^bb#212^z3(Summary) ^n219 Those types of consciousness in order are: 
Sixty-six, fifty-five, eleven, sixteen,
 seventy, and twenty without the occasionals.
Fifty-five, sixty-six, seventy-eight, seventy-three,
 fifty-one, and sixty-nine with the occasionals.
Analysis of Unwholesome Mental Factors	^bb#213^z3(Analysis) ^n220 1. Of the unwholesome mental factors, these four factors — delusion, shamelessness, fearlessness of wrongdoing, and restlessness — are called “universal unwholesome factors.”
 They are found in all twelve unwholesome types of consciousness.
^n221 2. Greed is found only in the eight types of consciousness accompanied by greed.
^n222 3. Wrong view arises in the four types of (greed-rooted) consciousness associated with wrong view.
^n223 4. Conceit is found in the four types of (greed-rooted) consciousness dissociated from wrong view. 
^n224 5. Hatred, envy, avarice, and worry are found in the two types of consciousness associated with aversion.
^n225 6. Sloth and torpor are found in the five types of prompted consciousness.
^n226 7. Doubt is found only in the type of consciousness associated with doubt.
^bb#214^z4(Summary)^n227 Four are found in all unwholesome states,
 three in those rooted in greed,
 four in those rooted in hatred,
 and so are two in the prompted.
Doubt is found in the consciousness accompanied by doubt.
 Thus, the fourteen (factors) are conjoined only with the twelve unwholesome (types of consciousness) in five ways.
Analysis of Beautiful Mental Factors	^bb#215^z3(The Beautiful Factors) ^z4(Analysis)^n228 1. Of the beautiful, firstly, the nineteen beautiful factors are found in all fifty-nine types of beautiful consciousness.
^n229 2. The three abstinences are necessarily found together in their entirety in every supramundane type of consciousness. But in the mundane sense-sphere wholesome types of consciousness, they are only sometimes present (and then) separately (8 + 8)= 16).
^n230 3. The illimitables arise at times variably in twenty-eight types of consciousness — namely, the twelve sublime types of consciousness excluding the fifth jhāna, the (eight types of) sense-sphere wholesome consciousness, and the (eight types of) sense- sphere functional consciousness with roots (12 + 8 + 8 = 28). Some, however, say that compassion and appreciative joy are not present in the types of consciousness accompanied by equanimity.
^n231 4. Wisdom goes into combination with forty-seven types of consciousness — namely, the twelve types of sense-sphere consciousness associated with knowledge, and the thirty- five sublime and supramundane types of consciousness (12 + 25 = 47).
^bb#216^z4(Summary)^n232 Nineteen states arise in fifty-nine,
 three in sixteen, two in twenty-eight types of consciousness.
Wisdom is declared to be found in forty-seven types.
 Thus, beautiful (factors) are found only in the beautiful (types of consciousness), combined in four ways.
^bb#217^z4(Fixed and Unfixed Adjuncts)^n233 Envy, avarice, worry, abstinences, compassion, etc. (that is, appreciative joy),
 and conceit arise separately and occasionally. So do sloth and torpor, but in combination. 
^n234 The remaining factors, apart from those mentioned above (52 – 11 = 41), are fixed adjuncts.
 Now I shall speak of their combination accordingly.
Introductory Verse of Mental Factors	^bb#218^z3(Introductory Verse) ^n235 Thirty-six factors arise in the supramundane (consciousness),
 thirty-five in the sublime,
 thirty-eight in the sense-sphere beautiful. 
Twenty-seven in the unwholesome,
 twelve in the rootless.
 According to the way they arise, their combination therein is fivefold. 
Analysis of Supramundane Consciousness	^bb#219^z4(Supramundane Consciousness)^z5(Analysis )^n236 How? 1. First, in the eight types of supramundane first jhāna consciousness, thirty-six factors enter into combination,
 namely, thirteen ethically variables and twenty-three beautiful mental factors, excluding the two illimitables (13 + 23 = 36).
2. Similarly, in the supramundane second jhāna types of consciousness, all the above are included except initial application (35).
3. In the third jhāna types of consciousness, (all those) excluding initial application and sustained application (34).
4. In the fourth jhāna types of consciousness, (all those) excluding initial application, sustained application, and zest (33).
5. In the fifth jhāna types of consciousness, those (same factors of the fourth jhāna) are included accompanied by equanimity (instead of happiness) (33).
Thus, altogether, for the eight types of supramundane consciousness, the combination is fivefold by way of the five kinds of jhāna. 
^bb#220^z5(Summary) ^n237 Respectively, there are thirty-six, thirty-five, thirty-four,
 and thirty-three in the last two. Thus, in five ways, they exist in the supramundane
Analysis of Sublime Consciousness	^bb#221^z4(Sublime Consciousness) ^z5(Analysis)^n238 1. In the sublime types of consciousness, first in the three types of first jhāna consciousness, thirty-five states enter into combination,
 namely, the thirteen ethically variable mental factors and twenty-two beautiful mental factors, excluding the three abstinences (13 + 22 = 35).
 But here, compassion and appreciative joy should be combined separately. 
2. Similarly, in the second jhāna consciousness (all those are included) except initial application (34).
3. In the third jhāna consciousness, all except initial application and sustained application (33).
4. In the fourth jhāna consciousness, all except initial application, sustained application, and zest (32).
5. In the fifteen (types of) fifth jhāna consciousness, the illimitables are not obtained (30). 
Thus altogether, for the twenty-seven types of sublime consciousness, the combination is fivefold by way of the five kinds of jhāna. 
^bb#222^z5(Summary)^n239 There are respectively thirty-five, thirty-four, thirty-three,
 thirty-two, and thirty. Fivefold is the combination in the sublime. 
Analysis of Sense-Sphere Beautiful Consciousness	^bb#223 ^z4(Sense-Sphere Beautiful Consciousness)^z5(Analysis)^n240 1. In the sense-sphere beautiful types of consciousness, first in the wholesome types of consciousness, in the first couplet, thirty-eight states enter into combination,
 namely, the thirteen ethically variable mental factors and the twenty-five beautiful mental factors (13 + 25 = 38).
 But here, the (two) illimitables and the (three) abstinences should be combined separately.
2. Similarly in the second couplet, (all those are included) excluding knowledge (37).
3. In the third couplet, associated with knowledge, (all those are included) excluding zest (37).
4. In the fourth couplet, (all) those are included excluding knowledge and zest (36).
In the functional types of consciousness, in the four couplets, those (mental factors) are included in the same four ways, except that the abstinences are excluded (35, 34, 34, 33). 
So too, in the resultant types of consciousness, those (mental factors) are included except that the illimitables and the abstinences are excluded (33, 32, 32, 31). 
Thus altogether, for the twenty-four sense-sphere beautiful types of conscious- ness, the combination is twelvefold by way of the couplets. 
^bb#224^z5(Summary)^n241 With respect to sense-sphere consciousness with roots — wholesome, resultant, and functional —,
 there arise in the wholesome (first pair) thirty-eight, twice thirty-seven (in the second and third pairs), and thirty six (in the fourth pair).
 In the functional, there are thirty-five (in the first pair), twice thirty-four (in the second and third pairs), and thirty-three (in the fourth pair).
 In the resultant, there are thirty-three (in the first pair), twice thirty-two (in the second and third pairs), and thirty-one (in the fourth pair). 
Distinctions among Beautiful Types	^bb#225 ^z4(Distinctions among Beautiful Types)^n242 Herein, the abstinences are not found in the functional consciousness or the sublime consciousness,
 nor are the illimitables found in the supramundane, nor is the pair (the abstinences and illimitables) present in the sense-sphere resultants.
In the supreme (that is, the supramundane), the jhāna factors are the basis of distinctions, in the middle (that is, the sublime), the illimitables (and jhāna factors),
 and in the limited (that is, the sense-sphere beautiful), the abstinences, knowledge, and zest are the basis of distinctions.
^bb#226^z5(Analysis ) ^n243 1. In the wholesome types of consciousness, first in those rooted in greed, in the first unprompted consciousness, nineteen states enter into combination,
 namely, the thirteen ethically variable mental factors and the four universal unwholesome mental factors, making seventeen, together with greed and wrong view (13 + 4 + 2 = 19).
^n244 2. Similarly, in the second unprompted consciousness, (the same seventeen are found together) with greed and conceit (13 + 4 + 2 = 19).
^n245 3. Similarly, in the third unprompted consciousness, there are eighteen states, together with greed and wrong view but excluding zest (12 + 4 + 2 = 18).
^n246 4. Similarly, in the fourth, (there are eighteen) with greed and conceit (12 + 4 + 2 = 18). 
^n247 5. In the fifth unprompted consciousness, that associated with aversion, these twenty states enter into combination — the above excluding zest but including the four: hatred, envy, avarice, and worry.
 But here, envy, avarice, and worry should be combined separately (12 + 4 + 4 = 20).
^n248 6. In the five types of prompted consciousness, the above states should similarly be combined with this difference, that sloth and torpor are included (thus: 21; 21; 20; 20; 22).
^n249 7. Chanda-pīti-vajjitā pana aññasamānā ekādasa akusalasādhāraṇā cattāro cā ti paṇṇarasa dhammā uddhaccasahagate sampayujjanti.
^n250 8. In the type of consciousness connected with doubt, fifteen states are similarly obtained by excluding decision and incorporating doubt (10 + 4 + 1 = 15).
Thus altogether, for the twelve types of unwholesome consciousness, the combination becomes sevenfold when reckoned according to their different adjuncts. 
^bb#227^z5(Summary)^n251 Nineteen, eighteen, twenty, twenty-one, twenty, twenty-two, fifteen
 — thus, they stand in seven ways in the unwholesome consciousness. 
^n252 These fourteen mental states, namely, the four unwholesome universals and ten variables,
 are said to be associated with all the unwholesome types of consciousness. 
Rootless Consciousness	^bb#228^z4(Rootless Consciousness) ^z5(Analysis)^n253 1. In the rootless types of consciousness, first in the smile-producing consciousness, twelve ethically variable states, excluding desire, enter into combination (7 + 5 =12).
^n254 2. Likewise, they occur in the determining consciousness, excluding desire and zest (7 + 4 = 11).
^n255 3. In the investigating consciousness accompanied by joy, all those except desire and energy occur (7 + 4 = 11).
^n256 4. In the triple mind element and in the pair of rootless rebirth-linking types of consciousness, all those except desire, zest, and energy occur (7 + 3 =10).
^n257 5. In the two types of fivefold sense consciousness, all those enter into combination except the occasionals (7).
^n258 Thus altogether, for the eighteen types of rootless consciousness, the combinations, numerically considered, constitute four groups. 
^bb#229^z5(Summary) Twelve, eleven, ten, seven — thus, the combination of eighteen rootless types of consciousness is fourfold. 
^n259 In all the rootless, the seven (universals) occur. The rest (the occasionals) arise according to the type.
 Thus, in detail, the combinations are told in thirty-three ways. 
^bb#230^z2(Conclusion) ^n260-300 Understanding thus the associations and combinations of the mental adjuncts,
 let one explain their classification through their union with consciousness as is fit. 
Thus ends the second chapter
in the Manual of Abhidhamma entitled “The Compendium of Mental Factors.”
Feeling	^ck#aas3^z1(Compendium of the Miscellaneous )^bb#301 ^z2(Introductory Verse)^n301 Having explained, accordingly, the fifty-three associated states (sampayutta) —^paste— with respect to their intrinsic nature (sabhāva), now, taking consciousness alone,
^cut｛consciousness (citta) and mental factors (cetasika) ｝
^n302  we will deal concisely with its classification by way of feelings (vedanā), roots (hetu), functions (kicca), doors (dvāra), objects (ālambana), and bases (vatthu).

^bb#302^z2(Analysis of Feeling)^n303 In the Compendium of Feeling, there are first three kinds of feeling (vedanā), namely, pleasant (sukha), painful (dukkha), and that which is neither painful not pleasant (adukkha-m-asukha).
 Again, feeling (vedanā) is analyzed as fivefold: pleasure (sukha), pain (dukkha), joy (somanassa), displeasure (domanassa), and equanimity (upekkhā). 
^bb#303^z3(Classification by way of Consciousness)^n304 Of them, wholesome-resultant body-consciousness is the only one accompanied by pleasure.
Similarly, unwholesome-resultant body-consciousness is the only one accompanied by pain.
^n305 ^paste 1. Eighteen types of sense-sphere consciousness — four rooted in greed,
 twelve types of sense-sphere beautiful consciousness,
 the two (rootless) types, that is, joyful investigating and smiling consciousness (4 + 12 + 2). 
2. Forty-four types of sublime and supramundane consciousness pertaining to the first, second, third, and fourth jhānas (12 + 32).
^cut｛There are sixty-two kinds of consciousness accompanied by joy, namely:｝
^n306 Only the two types of consciousness connected with aversion are accompanied by displeasure. 
^n307 All the remaining fifty-five types of consciousness are accompanied by equanimity. 
^bb#304^z3(Summary)^n308 Feeling, therein, is threefold, namely, pleasure (sukha), pain (dukkha), and equanimity (upekkhā).
 Together with joy (somanassa) and displeasure (domanassa), it is fivefold. 
^n309 Pleasure and pain are each found in one, displeasure in two,
 joy in sixty-two, and the remaining (that is, equanimity) in fifty-five. 
Roots	^bb#305^z2(compendium of roots)^z3(Analysis of Roots)^n310 In the compendium of roots (hetu), there are six roots, namely, greed (lobha), hatred (dosa), delusion (moha), non-greed (alobha), non-hatred (adosa), and non- delusion (amoha). 
^bb#306^z3(Classification by way of Consciousness)^n311 Therein, eighteen types of consciousness are without roots (ahetuka), namely, five-door adverting, the two sets of fivefold sense consciousness, receiving, investigating, determining, and smiling (1 + 5 + 5 + 2 + 3 + 1 + 1 = 18).
^n312 All the remaining seventy- one types of consciousness are with roots (sahetuka). 
^n313 Of them, the two types of consciousness associated with sheer delusion have only one root.
^n314 The remaining ten unwholesome types of consciousness and the twelve sense- sphere beautiful types of consciousness dissociated from knowledge — thus totaling twenty-two — are with two roots. 
^n315 The twelve sense-sphere beautiful types of consciousness associated with knowledge and the thirty-five sublime and supramundane types of consciousness — thus totaling forty-seven — are with three roots. 
^bb#307^z3(Summary)^n316 Greed, hatred, and delusion
 are the three unwholesome roots.
 Non-greed, non- hatred, and non-delusion
 are (the three roots that are) wholesome and indeterminate. 
^n317 It should be understood that eighteen types of consciousness are without roots,
 two with one root, twenty-two with two roots, and forty-seven with three roots.
Functions	^bb#308^z2(Compendium of Functions) ^z3(Analysis of Functions)^n318  In the compendium of functions, there are fourteen functions, namely:
 (1) rebirth- linking; (2) life-continuum; (3) adverting; (4) seeing; (5) hearing; (6) smelling; (7)tasting; (8) touching; (9) receiving; (10) investigating; (11) determining; (12) javana;(13)registration; and (14) death.
^n319 Their further classification should be understood by way of stage as tenfold, namely: (1) rebirth-linking; (2) life-continuum; (3) adverting; (4) fivefold sense consciousness; and so forth. 
^bb#309 ^z3(Classification by way of Consciousness)^n320 ^paste They are: two types of investigating consciousness accompanied by equanimity; eight great resultants; and nine fine-material-sphere and immaterial-sphere resultants (2 + 8 + 9 =19).
 ^cut｛Of them, nineteen types of consciousness perform the functions of rebirth-linking, life-continuum, and death.｝
^n321 Two perform the function of adverting.
^n322 Similarly, two perform each of the functions of seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting, touching, and receiving. 
^n323 Three perform the function of investigating. 
^n324 The mind-door adverting consciousness performs the function of determining in the five sense doors. 
^n325 With the exception of the two types of adverting consciousness, the fifty-five types of unwholesome, wholesome, fruition, and functional consciousness perform the function of javana. 
^n326 The eight great resultants and the three types of investigating consciousness, totaling eleven, perform the function of registration. 
^bb#310^z3(Classification by Number of Functions)^n327 Of them, the two types of investigating consciousness accompanied by equanimity perform five functions: rebirth-linking, life-continuum, death, registration, and investigating. 
^n328 The eight great resultants perform four functions: rebirth-linking, life-continuum, death, and registration. 
^n329 The nine sublime resultants perform three functions: rebirth-relinking, life- continuum, and death. 
^n330 The investigating consciousness accompanied by joy performs two functions: investigating and registration. 
^n331 Similarly, the determining consciousness performs two functions: determining and adverting.
^n332 All the remaining types of consciousness — javana, the triple mind element, and the fivefold sense consciousness — perform only one function as they arise. 
^bb#311^z3(Summary)^n333 The types of consciousness are declared to be fourteen according to functions such as rebirth-linking and so forth,
 and ten according to analysis by stages.
^n334 It is stated that those which perform one function are sixty-eight; two functions, two; three functions, nine;
 four functions, eight; and five functions, two respectively. 
Doors	^bb#312^z2(Compendium of Doors) ^z3(Analysis of Doors)^n335 In the Compendium of Doors, there are six doors, namely: eye door, ear door, nose door, tongue door, body door, and mind door.
^n336 Therein, the eye itself is the eye door,
^n337  and also for the ear door and the others. 
^n338 But the life-continuum is called “the mind door.” 
^bb#313^z3(Classification by way of Consciousness)^n339 ^paste five-door adverting, eye-consciousness, receiving, investigating, determining, sense-sphere javanas, and registration. 
^cut｛Therein, forty-six types of consciousness arise in the eye door according to circumstances:｝
Likewise in the ear door, etc., forty-six types of consciousness arise, five-door adverting, ear-consciousness, and so forth. 
It should be understood that, altogether, the fifty-four types of sense-sphere consciousness occur in the five doors. 
^n340 In the mind-door, sixty-seven types of consciousness arise: mind-door adverting, fifty-five javanas, and registration. 
^n341 Nineteen types of consciousness are door-freed, occurring by way of rebirth- linking, life-continuum, and death. 
^bb#314^z3(Classification by Number of Doors)^n342  Of those (that arise through doors), thirty-six types of consciousness — the two sets of fivefold sense consciousness and the sublime and supramundane javanas — are with one door accordingly. 
^n343 The three mind elements arise through five doors. 
^n344 Joyful investigation, determining, and sense-sphere javanas arise through six ^i(doors.)
^n345 Investigating consciousness accompanied by equanimity
^n346  and the great resultants arise either through the six doors or as door-freed. The sublime resultants always arise as door-freed. 
^bb#315^z3(Summary)^n347 Thirty-six types of consciousness arise through one door, three through five doors,
 thirty-one through six doors, ten through six doors or as door-freed,
 nine wholly free from a door.
 Thus, in five ways, they are shown.
Objects	^bb#316^z2(Compendium of Objects) ^z3(Analysis of Objects)^n348 In the compendium of objects, there are six kinds of objects, namely, visible form object, sound object, smell object, taste object, tangible object, and mental object. 
^n349 Therein, visible form itself is visible form object. Likewise, sound, etc., are sound object, etc.
^n350 But mental object is sixfold: sensitive matter, subtle matter, consciousness, mental factors, Nibbāna, and concepts. 
^bb#317^z4(Classification by way of Doors) ^n351 For all types of eye-door consciousness, visible form alone is the object, and that pertains only to the present.
 Likewise, sounds, etc., are the object of ear-door conscious- ness, etc., and those too pertain only to the present. 
^n352 But the object of mind-door consciousness is of six kinds, and that object may be present, past, future, or independent of time, according to circumstances. 
^n353 Further, in the case of door-freed consciousness — that is, rebirth-linking, life- continuum, and death (consciousness) —, the object is sixfold, and, according to the situation, (that object) has usually been apprehended in (one of) the six doors in the immediately preceding existence, as either a past or present object or as a concept. It is known as “kamma,” or as “a sign of kamma,” or as “a sign of destiny.” 
^bb#318^z4(Classification by Type of Consciousness) ^n354 Of these, eye-consciousness, etc., each take a single object, respectively, visible form, etc.
^n355 But the triple mind element takes (all) five kinds of (sense) object, visible form, etc.
^n356 The remaining have only sense-sphere objects. 
^n357 The unwholesome (consciousness) and the sense-sphere javana that are dissociated from knowledge take all objects except supramundane states. 
^n358 The sense-sphere wholesome (consciousness) associated with knowledge, and the wholesome direct-knowledge consciousness consisting in the fifth jhāna, take all objects except the path and fruit of Arahantship. 
^n359 The sense-sphere functionals associated with knowledge, the functional direct- knowledge consciousness, and the determining consciousness can all take all kinds of objects. 
^n360 Among the immaterial (consciousness), the second and fourth take sublime objects.
^n361 All the remaining sublime consciousnesses take concepts as objects.
^n362The supra-mundane consciousnesses take Nibbāna as object. 
^bb#319^z3(Summary )^n363 Twenty-five types of consciousness are connected with lower objects; six with the sublime;
 twenty-one with concepts; eight with Nibbāna. 
Twenty are connected with all objects except the supramundane;
 five with all except the highest path and fruit; and six with all. Thus, sevenfold is their grouping. 
Bases	^bb#320^z2(Compendium of Bases)^z3(Analysis of Bases) ^n364 In the summary of bases, there are six bases, namely, eye-base, ear-base, nose- base, tongue-base, body-base, and heart-base. 
^n365 All these, too, are found in the sense world.
^n366 But in the fine-material world, these bases — nose, tongue, and body — are not found.
^n367 In the immaterial world, no base exists. 
^bb#321^z4(Classification by Way of Consciousness)^n368 Therein, the five elements of sense consciousness occur entirely dependent upon the five sensitive parts (of the sense organs) as their respective bases (2 x 5 = 10).
^n369 But the mind element — namely, the five-door-adverting consciousness and the (two types of) receiving consciousness — occur in dependence on the heart.
^n370 Likewise, those that remain — namely, the mind-consciousness element comprising the investigating consciousness, the great resultants, the two accompanied by aversion, the first path consciousness, smiling consciousness, and fine-material-sphere consciousness — occur in dependence on the heart (3 + 3 + 8 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 15 =33). 
^n371 The remaining classes of consciousness, whether wholesome, unwholesome, functional, or supramundane, may be either dependent on, or independent of, the heart- base (12 + 10 + 13 + 7 = 42).
^n372 The immaterial-sphere resultants are independent of the heart-base (4). 
^bb#322^z3(Summary)^n373 It should be noted that, in the sensory plane, seven elements are dependent on six bases, in the fine-material plane,
 four are dependent on three bases,in the immaterial plane, the one single element is not dependent on any. 
^n374 ^n400 Forty-three (types of consciousness) arise dependent on a base.
 Forty-two arise with or without a base. The immaterial resultants arise without any base. 
Thus ends the third chapter
in the Manual of Abhidhamma entitled “The Compendium of the Miscellaneous.”
Cognitive Process	^bb#401^ck#aas4^z1(Compendium of the Cognitive Process) ^z2(Introductory Verse)^n401 Having thus completed the excellent compendium of states of consciousness,
 I shall briefly explain the occurrence of consciousness both at rebirth-linking and during the course of existence,
 according to the planes and individuals,
 and as determined by what (states of consciousness) precede and follow. 
^bb#402^z2(Enumeration Of Categories)^z3(The Six Sixes)^n402 ^paste 1. Six bases;
2. Six doors;
3. Six objects;
4. Six types of consciousness;
5. Six processes; and
6. Sixfold presentation of objects.
^cut｛In the compendium of the cognitive process, six classes, each with six members, should be understood: ｝
^n403 The presentation of objects to the process-freed consciousness is threefold, namely, kamma, sign of kamma (kammanimitta), and sign of destiny (gatinimitta).
^n404 The bases (vatthu), doors (dvāra), and objects (ālambana) therein are as described before. 
^bb#403^z4(Six Types of Consciousness) ^n405 The six types of consciousness are: eye-consciousness, ear-consciousness, nose- consciousness, tongue-consciousness, body-consciousness, and mind-consciousness. 
^bb#404^z4(Six Processes) ^n406 According to the doors, the six cognitive processes are as follows: 
1. The process connected with the eye door;
2. The process connected with the ear door;
3. The process connected with the nose door;
4. The process connected with the tongue door;
5. The process connected with the body door; and
6. The process connected with the mind door.
Or, according to consciousness, the cognitive processes are: 
1. The process connected with eye-consciousness;
2. The process connected with ear-consciousness;
3. The process connected with nose-consciousness;
4. The process connected with tongue-consciousness;
5. The process connected with body-consciousness; and
6. The process connected with mind-consciousness.
The cognitive processes connected with the doors should be coordinated (with the corresponding consciousness). 
Presentation of Objects	^bb#405^z3(Sixfold Presentation of Objects) ^n407 ^paste A. At the five sense doors, it is: (1) very great, (2) great, (3) slight, and (4) very slight. 
B. At the mind door, it is: (1) clear and (2) obscure.
^cut｛The sixfold presentation of objects should be understood as follows: ｝
^bb#406^z4(The Very Great Object) ^n408 How (is the intensity in the presentation of objects determined)? One mind- moment consists of the three (sub-)moments ─ arising, presence, and dissolution.
^n409 The duration of material phenomena consists of seventeen such mind-moments.
^n410 The five sense objects enter the avenue of the five sense doors at the stage of presence, when one or several mind-moments have passed.
Therefore, if a visible form as object, having passed one mind-moment (i), enters the avenue of the eye, the life-continuum vibrates for two mind-moments and is arrested (ii, iii).
 Then, a five-door adverting consciousness arises and ceases adverting to that same visible form as object (iv).
 Immediately after, there arise and cease in due order: (v) Eye-consciousness seeing that form;
(vi) Receiving consciousness receiving it;
(vii) Investigating consciousness investigating it;
(viii) Determining consciousness determining it.
Following this, any one of the twenty-nine sense-sphere javanas that has gained the right conditions runs its course, generally for seven mind-moments (ix-xv).
 After the javanas, two registration resultants arise accordingly (xvi-xvii).
 Then comes the subsidence into the life-continuum (bhavanga). 
^n411 To this extent, seventeen mind-moments are completed, namely, fourteen acts of process consciousness, two vibrations of the life-continuum, and one mind-moment that had passed prior to (the process).
 Then the object ceases. The object is called “very great.” 
^bb#407^z4(The Great Object) ^n412 The object is called “great” when it enters the avenue of sense after having passed (a few moments) and is unable to survive till the arising of the registration mind-moments.
 In that case, at the end of the javanas, there is subsidence into the life-continuum and no arising of registration consciousness.
^bb#408^z4(The Slight Object) ^n413 The object is called “slight” when it enters the avenue of sense after having passed (a few moments) and is unable to survive till the arising of the javanas.
 In that case, even the javanas do not arise, but the determining consciousness occurs for two or three moments,
 and then there is subsistence into the life-continuum. 
^bb#409 ^z4(The Very Slight Object) ^n414The object is called “very slight” when it enters the avenue of sense as it is on the verge of ceasing and, after having passed (a few moments), is unable to survive until the arising of the determining consciousness.
 In that case, there is merely vibration of the life-continuum, but no arising of a cognitive process. 
^bb#410  Fourfold Presentation of Objects ^n415 As in the eye door, so in the ear door, etc.
Thus, in all the five doors, 
^paste 1. The course (ending with) registration; 2. The course (ending with) javana; 3. The course (ending with) determining; and 4. The futile course.
^cut｛the fourfold presentation of objects should be understood, in due order, in the four ways known as: ｝
^bb#411^z4(Summary) ^n416 There are seven modes and fourteen different states of consciousness in the cognitive process.
 In detail, there are, accordingly, fifty-four in the five doors. 
Herein, this is the method of the cognitive process in the five sense doors. 
Limited Javana Process	^bb#412^z3(The Limited Javana Process)^n417 When a clear object enters the avenue of the mind door, then, the vibration of the life-continuum, mind-door adverting, javanas, and, at the end of the javanas, registration resultants, all take place. Following this, there is subsidence into the life-continuum. 
^n418 In the case of an obscure object, there is subsidence into the life-continuum at the end of the javanas, without giving rise to the registration resultants. 
^bb#413^z4(Summary)^n419 Three modes and ten different states (of consciousness) in the cognitive process are told.
 It should be explained that, in detail, there are forty-one kinds here. 
Herein, this is the limited javana section. 
Absorption Process	^bb#414^z3(The Process of Absorption) ^n420 In the occurrence of javanas in absorption, there is no distinction between clear and obscure (objects).
 Likewise, there is no arising of registration consciousness.
^n421 In this case (that is, in the process of absorption), any one of the eight sense-sphere javanas accompanied by knowledge arises and ceases four times or three times, in due order, as preparation, access, conformity, and change-of-lineage.
 Immediately after they cease, in the fourth or fifth moment as the case may be, any one of the javanas along with the twenty-six types of sublime or supramundane javanas enters upon the process of absorption in accordance with the way the mind is conveyed.
 After that, at the end of absorption, there is subsidence into the life-continuum. 
^bb#415^z4(Correlations in Absorption) ^n422  Therein, immediately after a javana accompanied by joy, absorption (appanā) accompanied by joy may be expected.
 Immediately after a javana accompanied by equanimity (upekkhā), absorption (occurs) accompanied by equanimity. 
Therein, too, immediately after a wholesome javana, absorption occurs through a wholesome javana and the three lower fruits.
 Immediately after a functional javana, absorption occurs through a functional javana and the fruit of Arahantship. 
^bb#416^z4(Summary) ^n423 After wholesome consciousness accompanied by joy, thirty-two (classes of absorption javanas) arise. Following (wholesome consciousness) accompanied by equanimity, twelve (classes of absorption javanas arise).
 After functionals accompanied by joy, eight classes arise, and, following (functionals) accompanied by equanimity, six classes arise. 
^n424 For worldlings (puthujjana) and trainees (sekkha), absorption occurs following a three-rooted wholesome sense-sphere consciousness.
 For those free from lust (that is, Arahants), absorption follows a three-rooted sense-sphere functional consciousness. 
Herein, this is the method of the cognitive process in the mind door. 
Registration	^bb#417 ^z3( Analysis of Registration) ^n425 Here, under all circumstances, when an object is undesirable, the fivefold sense consciousness, reception, investigation, and registration (that arise) are unwholesome- resultants.
^n426 When (the object is) desirable, they are wholesome-resultants.
^n427 If the object is extremely desirable, investigation and registration are accompanied by joy. 
In this connection, too, at the end of the functional javanas accompanied by joy, there arise registration mind-moments also accompanied by joy.
 At the end of the functional javanas accompanied by equanimity, the registration mind-moments are also accompanied by equanimity. 
^bb#418^z4(The Adventitious Bhavanga) ^n428 But, at the end of the javanas accompanied by displeasure, the registration mind-moments and the life-continuum are both accompanied by equanimity.
 Therefore, in the case of one whose rebirth-consciousness is accompanied by joy, if, at the end of javanas accompanied by displeasure, there is no occurrence of registration mind-moments,
 then, ^paste  there arises an investigating consciousness accompanied by equanimity apprehending any familiar trivial object.
 Immediately after that, there is subsidence into the life-continuum. ^cut｛ the teachers explain,｝
^bb#419^z4(The Law of Registration) ^n429 Likewise, they hold that registration occurs (only) at the end of sense-sphere javanas, (only) to sense-sphere beings, only when sense-sphere phenomena become objects. 
^bb#420  Summary ^n430 Registration occurs, they say, in connection with clear and very great objects when there is certainty as regards sense-sphere javanas, beings, and objects. 

Herein, this is the procedure of registration. 
Javana	^bb#421^z3(The Procedure of Javana) ^z4(Sense-Sphere Javana)^n431 Among the javanas, in a limited javana process, the sense-sphere javanas run only for seven or six times.
^n432  But, in the case of a feeble process such as the time of dying, etc., they run only five times.
^n433 To the Exalted One, at the time of the Twin Miracle and the like, when the procedure is rapid, only four or five occasions of reviewing consciousness occur, they also say.
^bb#422^z4(Javana in Attainments) ^n434 The sublime javanas for a beginner during the first (cognitive process of) absorption, and the direct-knowledge javanas (abhiññājavana) always, run only once. Then comes subsidence into the life-continuum. 
^n435 The arising of the four paths endures for only one mind-moment.
 Thereafter, two or three occasions of fruition consciousness arise according to the case.
 Then comes the subsidence into the life-continuum. 
^n436 At the time of the attainment of cessation (nirodha), the fourth immaterial javana runs twice and then contacts cessation.
^n437 When emerging (from cessation), either the fruition (phala) consciousness of non-returning (anāgāmi) or the fruition consciousness of Arahantship arises accordingly for a single occasion.
 When it ceases, there is subsidence into the life-continuum.
^n438 In the cognitive process of attainments, as in the stream of the life-continuum, there is no fixed procedure regarding the processes.
 It should be understood that even many (sublime and supramundane) javanas take place (in immediate succession). 
^bb#423  Summary ^n439 It should be known that limited javanas arise seven times, the path and direct knowledge only once,
 the rest (sublime and supramundane) many times. 
Herein, this is the procedure of javanas. 
The way of Individuals	^z3(Analysis of the Way of Individuals) ^bb#424^z4(Rootless and Double Rooted) ^n440 Herein, to those with double-rooted and rootless (rebirth consciousness), functional javanas (kriyājavana) and absorption javanas (appanājavana) do not arise.
^n441 Likewise, in a blissful plane, resultants accompanied by knowledge also do not arise.
^n442 But, in a woeful plane, great resultants dissociated from knowledge are not found.
^bb#425^z4(Triple Rooted) ^n443 Amongst those with triple-rooted (rebirth consciousness), to Arahants, no wholesome or unwholesome javanas arise.
^n444 Similarly, to trainees and worldlings, functional javanas do not arise.
^n445 Nor do javanas associated with wrong view and doubt arise to the trainees.
^n446 To non-returner individuals, there are no javanas associated with aversion.
^n447 But the supramundane javanas are experienced only by noble ones according to their respective capacities.
^bb#426^z4(Summary) ^n448 According to circumstances, it is said, those beyond training experience forty-four classes of consciousness,
 trainees fifty-six, and the rest fifty-four. 
Herein, this is the analysis by way of individuals. 
Planes	^bb#427^z3(Analysis) ^n449 In the sense-sphere plane, all these foregoing cognitive processes occur according to circumstances.
^n450 In the fine-material-sphere plane, (all occur) with the exception of javanas connected with aversion and registration moments. 
^n451 In the immaterial-sphere plane, (all occur) with the (further) exception of the first path, fine-material-sphere consciousness, smiling consciousness, and the lower immaterial classes of consciousness. 
^bb#428  Special Cases ^n452 In all planes, to those who are devoid of particular sense organs, cognitive processes connected with the corresponding doors do not arise. 
^n453 To the non-percipient beings, there is absolutely no cognitive process whatsoever. 
^bb#429^z4(Summary) ^n454 In the sense-sphere plane, according to circumstances, eighty kinds of process consciousness are found,
 in the fine-material plane, there are sixty-four, and, in the immaterial plane, forty-two. 
Herein, this is the analysis by way of planes. 
^bb#430^z3(Conclusion) ^n455 ^n500 Thus, the cognitive process connected with the six doors, according to circumstances, continues on uninterrupted as long as life lasts, intercepted by the life-continuum (bhavanga). 
Thus ends the fourth chapter in the Manual of Abhidhamma entitled “The Compendium of the Cognitive Process.” 

Process-Freed	^ck#aas5^z1(Compendium of the Process-Freed)^bb#501^z2(Introductory Verse) ^n501 Thus, the compendium of the occurrence (of consciousness) has been explained by way of the cognitive process during the course of existence.

Four Types of Rebirth	^bb#509^z3(The Four Types of Rebirth-Linking) ^z4(Overview ) ^n515 ^paste 1. Rebirth-linking in the woeful plane; 
2. Rebirth-linking in the sensory blissful plane;
3. Rebirth-linking in the fine-material sphere; and
4. Rebirth-linking in the immaterial sphere.
^cut｛Rebirth-linking is fourfold, namely: ｝
^bb#510^z4(Rebirth-linking in the Woeful Planes) ^n516 Therein, the unwholesome-resultant investigating consciousness accompanied by equanimity becomes the rebirth-linking (consciousness) at the moment of descent into the woeful plane. Then, it lapses into the life-continuum, and finally it becomes the death (consciousness) and is cut off. This is the one single woeful rebirth-linking. 
^bb#511^z4(Rebirth-Linking in the Sensory Blissful Plane) ^n517 The wholesome-resultant investigating consciousness accompanied by equanimity occurs as the rebirth-linking, life-continuum and death (consciousness) of deformed human beings of the sensory blissful plane, such as those born blind, etc., as well as (some) earth-bound (deities) and of (some) fallen asuras.
^n518 The eight great resultants act as the rebirth-linking, life-continuum, and death (consciousness) everywhere in the sensory blissful plane.
^n519 These nine comprise rebirth-linking in the sensory blissful plane. 
^n520 The (foregoing) ten modes are reckoned as sense-sphere rebirth-linking. 
^bb#512^z4(Sensory Plane Life-Spans) ^n521 There is no definite limit to the duration of life of beings in the four woeful planes, or among humans and fallen asuras. 
^n522 The life-span of gods of the realm of the four great kings is five hundred celestial years,
 that is, according to human reckoning, 9,000,000 years. 
The life-span of the thirty-three gods is four times this amount.
 The life-span of the yāma gods is four times that of the thirty-three.
 Four times that amount is the life-span of the delightful gods.
 Four times that amount is the life-span of the gods who rejoice in their creations.
 Four times that amount is the life-span of the gods who lord over the creation of others.
^n523 In the plane of gods who lord over others’ creations, the life-span, according to human reckoning,
 is nine-hundred twenty-one koṭis of years plus sixty-hundred-thousand years (9,216,000,000). 
Fine Material Sphere	^bb#513^z4(Rebirth-Linking in the Fine-Material Sphere) ^n524 The first jhāna resultant occurs in the first jhāna plane as the rebirth-linking, life-continuum, and death (consciousness);
^n525  similarly, the second jhāna resultant and the third jhāna resultant (occur thus) in the second jhāna plane;
^n526 the fourth jhāna resultant in the third jhāna plane;
^n527 the fifth jhāna resultant in the fourth jhāna plane.
^n528 But for non-percipient beings, material form itself occurs as rebirth-linking.
Similarly thereafter, during the course of existence and at the moment of death, only material form exists and perishes. 
These are the six modes of rebirth-linking in the fine-material sphere. 
^bb#514^z5(Life-Spans in the Fine-Material Sphere) ^n529 Among these, the life-span of the gods of Brahmā’s realm is one-third of an eon;
^n530 of Brahmā’s Ministers, half an eon;
^n531 of Mahā Brahmās, one eon;
^n532 of the gods of Minor Luster, two eons;
^n533 of Infinite Luster, four eons;
^n534 of Radiant Luster, eight eons;
^n535 of Minor Aura, sixteen eons;
^n536 of Infinite Aura, thirty-two eons;
^n537 of Steady Aura, sixty-four eons;
^n538 of Great Reward and Non-percipient Beings, five hundred eons;
^n539 of Durable Gods, one thousand eons;
^n540 of Serene Gods, two thousand eons;
^n541 of Beautiful Gods, four thousand eons;
^n542 of Clear-sighted Gods, eight thousand eons;
^n543 of the Highest Gods, sixteen thousand eons. 
Immaterial Sphere	^bb#515^z4(Rebirth-Linking in the Immaterial Sphere) ^n544 The first immaterial resultant occurs as the rebirth-linking, life-continuum, and death (consciousness) in the first immaterial plane, and the others occur in the same functions in their respective planes.
 These are the four modes of rebirth-linking in the immaterial sphere. 
^bb#516^z5(Life-Spans in the Immaterial Sphere) ^n545 Among them, the life-span of gods who have attained to the realm of Infinite Space is twenty thousand eons;
^n546 of those who have attained to the realm of Infinite Consciousness, forty thousand eons;
^n547 of those who have attained to the realm of Nothingness, sixty thousand eons;
^n548 of those who have attained to the realm of Neither-Perception-nor-Non-perception, eighty-four thousand eons.
^bb#517  Summary ^n549 The rebirth-linking consciousness, life-continuum consciousness, and the death consciousness
 in one (particular) birth are similar and have an identical object. 
Herein, these are the four types of rebirth-linking. 
Four Types of Kamma	^z3(Four Types of Kamma)^bb#518 ^z4(By Way of Function) ^n550 ^paste (i) Productive kamma;

^bb#520^z4(By Time of Ripening) ^n552 ^paste (i) Immediately effective kamma;
(ii) Subsequently effective kamma;
(iii) Indefinitely effective kamma; and

(ii) Wholesome kamma pertaining to the sense-sphere;
(iii) Wholesome kamma pertaining to the fine-material sphere; and
(iv) Wholesome kamma pertaining to the immaterial sphere.
^cut｛4. With respect to the place in which the effect takes place, there are four kinds of kamma, namely: ｝
Unwholesome Kamma	^z4(Unwholesome and Wholesome Kamma) ^bb#522 ^z5(Unwholesome Kamma)^n554 Of them, unwholesome kamma is threefold according to the doors of action, namely: bodily action, verbal action, and mental action. 
^n555 How? Killing, stealing, and sexual misconduct are bodily actions generally occurring through the door of the body, known as “bodily intimation.”
^n556 False speech, slandering, harsh speech, and frivolous talk are verbal actions generally occurring through the door of speech, known as “vocal intimation.” 
^n557 Covetousness, ill will, and wrong view are mental actions generally occurring only in the mind without (bodily or vocal) intimation. 
^bb#523^z5(By Way of Roots and Consciousness) ^n558 Of them, killing, harsh speech, and ill will spring from the root of hatred;
^n559  sexual misconduct, covetousness, and wrong view from the root of greed;
^n560 the remaining four arise from the two roots.
^n561 According to the classes of consciousness, this unwholesome kamma is altogether twelvefold. 
Wholesome Kamma	^bb#524^z5(Wholesome Kamma of the Sense Sphere) ^n562 Wholesome kamma of the sense sphere is threefold according to the doors of action, namely, bodily action pertaining to the door of the body, verbal action pertaining to the door of speech, and mental action pertaining to the door of the mind. 
^n563 Similarly, it is threefold as generosity, virtue, and meditation.
^n564 But it is eightfold according to the classes of consciousness. 
^n565 It is also tenfold as: (1) generosity; (2) virtue; (3) meditation; (4) reverence; (5) service; (6) transference of merit; (7) rejoicing in the merit of others; (8) hearing the Dhamma; (9) teaching the Dhamma; and (10) straightening out one’s views. 
^n566 All these twenty kinds (unwholesome and wholesome) are known as “kamma pertaining to the sense sphere.” 
^bb#525^z5(Wholesome Kamma and the Fine-Material Sphere) ^n567 Wholesome kamma of the fine-material sphere is purely mental action.
 It consists in meditation that has reached absorption and is fivefold by distinction of the jhāna factors. 
^bb#526^z5(Wholesome Kamma of the Immaterial Sphere) ^n568 So too, wholesome kamma of the immaterial sphere is purely mental action.
 It consists in meditation that has reached absorption
 and is fourfold by distinction of the object. 
Results	^z4(Results of Kamma) ^bb#527 ^z5(Results of Unwholesome Kamma) ^n569 Herein, unwholesome kamma excluding restlessness produces rebirth-linking in the woeful plane.
 But, during the course of existence, all twelve (unwholesome classes of consciousness) give effect to the seven unwholesome resultants anywhere in the sensory world or the fine-material world, according to circumstances. 
^bb#528^z5(Results of Sense-Sphere Wholesome Kamma)^n570 Wholesome kamma of the sense sphere produces rebirth-linking in the sensory blissful plane, and, so too, (it produces) the great resultants in the course of existence.
 But it gives effect to the eight rootless resultants anywhere in the sensory world or the fine-material world, according to circumstances.
^bb#529^z5(Wholesome Results and the Roots) ^n571 Therein, superior wholesome kamma accompanied by three roots produces rebirth-linking similarly accompanied by three roots, and, during the course of existence, it gives effect to sixteen kinds of resultants. 
^n572 Wholesome kamma of an inferior grade accompanied by three roots, and that of a superior grade accompanied by two roots, produces rebirth-linking with two roots and gives effect to twelve kinds of resultants, excluding those with three roots, during the course of existence. 
^n573 But wholesome kamma of an inferior grade accompanied by two roots produces rebirth-linking without roots and gives effect to rootless resultants during the course of existence. 
^bb#530  An Alternative View ^n574 Some (teachers) say that unprompted (states of consciousness) do not produce prompted resultants,
 and prompted (states of consciousness) do not produce unprompted resultants. 
^paste set forth in due order as twelve, ten, and eight.

Results of Fine Material	^bb#531^z5(Results of Fine-Material-Sphere Wholesome Kamma)^n575 As regards wholesome kamma of the fine-material sphere, those who develop the first jhāna to a limited degree are reborn into Brahmā’s Retinue.
^n576 Developing the same to a medium degree, they are reborn among Brahmā’s Ministers.
^n577 Developing it to a superior degree, they are reborn among the Mahā Brahmās.
^n578 Similarly, developing the second jhāna and the third jhāna to a limited degree, they are reborn among the gods of Minor Luster.
^n579 Developing them to a medium degree, they are reborn among the gods of Infinite Luster.
^n580 Developing them to a superior degree, they are reborn among the gods of Radiant Luster. 
^n581 Developing the fourth jhāna to a limited degree, they are reborn among the gods of Minor Aura.
^n582 Developing it to a medium degree, they are reborn among the gods of Infinite Aura.
^n583 Developing it to a superior degree, they are reborn among the gods of Steady Aura. 
^n584 Developing the fifth jhāna, they are reborn among the gods of Great Reward.
^n585 Developing dispassion towards perception, they are reborn among the Non-percipient Beings.
^n586 But non-returners are reborn in the Pure Abodes. 
^bb#532^z5(Results of Immaterial-Sphere Wholesome Kamma) ^n587 Developing wholesome kamma of the immaterial sphere, they are reborn in the immaterial planes corresponding (to their attainment). 
^bb#533^z3(Conclusion) ^n588 Thus, sublime merit, determined according to planes,
 produces similar results (both) at rebirth-linking and in the course of existence. 
 Herein, this is the fourfold kamma. 
Death	^z4(The Process of Death and Rebirth) ^bb#534  Four Causes of Death ^n589 ^paste (1) through the expiration of the life-span;
 (2) through the expiration of the (productive) karmic force;
 (3) through the (simultaneous) expiration of both;
 and (4) through (the intervention of) a destructive kamma. 
^cut｛The advent of death is fourfold, namely: ｝
^bb#535^z5(The Signs at the Time of Death) ^n590 ^paste 1. A kamma that is to produce rebirth-linking in the next existence, which, according to circumstances, confronts (the dying person); or
2. A sign of kamma (kammanimitta), that is, a form, etc., that had been apprehended previously at the time of performing the kamma or something that was instrumental in performing the kamma; or 
3. A sign of destiny (gatinimitta), that is, (a symbol) to be obtained and experienced in the immediately following existence.
^cut｛Now, in the case of those who are about to die, at the time of death, one of the following presents itself through any of the six (sense) doors: ｝
^bb#536  ^z5(The Mind at the Time of Death) Thereafter, attending to that object thus presented, the stream of consciousness — in accordance with the kamma that is to be matured, whether pure or corrupted, and in conformity with the state into which one is to be reborn — continually flows, inclining mostly towards that state.
 Or that rebirth-productive kamma presents itself to a sense door in the way of renewing. 
Rebirth-Linking	^bb#537^z5(Death and Rebirth-Linking) ^n591 To one who is on the verge of death, either at the end of a cognitive process or at the dissolution of the life-continuum, the death consciousness, the consummation of the present life, arises and ceases in the way of death. 
Immediately after that (death consciousness) has ceased, a rebirth-linking consciousness arises and is established in the subsequent existence, apprehending the object thus obtained, either supported by the heart-base or baseless, as is appropriate; it is generated by a volitional formation that is enveloped by latent ignorance (avijjā) and rooted in latent craving (taṇhā). That rebirth-linking consciousness, so called because it links together the two consecutive existences, is conjoined with its mental adjuncts and acts as the fore-runner to the conascent states as their locus (or foundation). 
^bb#538^z6(Objects of Sense-Sphere Rebirth Consciousness) ^n592 Herein, in the death-proximate cognitive process, only five feebly occurring javanas should be expected.
 Therefore, when death takes place while present objects are occurring and have entered the avenue of sense,
 then, the rebirth-linking and life continuum (of the new existence) also take a present object.
 In the case of the sense-sphere rebirth-linking, when the object is a sign of kamma or a sign of destiny perceived at any of the six doors, that object may be present, or it may be past.
 But kamma (as object) is only past, and it is perceived only at the mind door.
 All these objects (of sense-sphere rebirth are limited phenomena only. 
^bb#539^z6(Objects of Sublime Rebirth Consciousness)^n593 In the case of rebirth-linking in the fine-material sphere, the object is a concept and is always a sign of kamma.
^n594 So too, in the case of rebirth-linking in the immaterial sphere, the object — which may be a sublime state or a concept, whichever is appropriate — is always a sign of kamma.
 In the case of non-percipient beings, only the vital nonad becomes established in the way of rebirth-linking.
 Hence, they are called “materially reborn.”
 Those in the immaterial planes are called “mentally reborn.”
 The rest are called “materially and mentally reborn.” 
Rebirth	^bb#540^z6(Determination of Rebirth) ^n595 When one passes away from an immaterial realm, one may be reborn in superior immaterial realms but not in lower immaterial realms,
 and one may also be reborn in the sensory plane with a three-rooted rebirth-consciousness. 
When one passes away from the fine-material sphere, one is not reborn without roots.
 After passing away from a three-rooted existence in the sensory plane, one may be reborn anywhere. The rest (that is, those who pass away with two roots and no roots) are reborn only in the sense-sphere realms.
Herein, this is the procedure with regard to death and rebirth. 
^bb#541^z6(The Continuity of Consciousness) ^n596 So, for those who have thus taken rebirth, from the moment immediately following the cessation of the rebirth-linking (consciousness), that same type of consciousness apprehending that same object flows on uninterruptedly like the stream of a river, and it does so until the arising of the death consciousness, so long as there is no occurrence of a cognitive process.
 Being an essential factor of existence (or life), this consciousness is called the “life-continuum” (bhavanga).
^n597 At the end of life, having become the death consciousness on the occasion of passing away, it then ceases.
^n598 Thereafter, the rebirth-linking consciousness and the others continue to occur, revolving in the sequence like the wheel of a cart. 
^bb#542^z4(Conclusion) ^n599^n600 Just as here, so again in the next existence, there arise rebirth-linking consciousness, life-continuum, cognitive process, and death consciousness.
 Again, with rebirth and life-continuum, this stream of consciousness turns round.
The wise, disciplining themselves long, understand the impermanence (of life), realize the deathless state,
 and, completely cutting off the fetters of attachment, attain peace.

Matterial	^ck#aas6^z1(Compendium of Matter) ^bb#601^z2(Introductory Verse) ^n601 Having thus far analyzed
 consciousness and mental factors in accordance with their classes and modes of occurrence, matter (rūpa) will now be dealt with. 
^n602 ^paste enumeration, classification, origination, groups,
 and the modes of occurrence. ^cut｛The compendium of matter is fivefold: ｝
^bb#602^z2(Great Essentials and Derived Matter)^z3(In Brief: Great Essentials and Derived Matter) ^n603 Matter is twofold, namely: the four great essentials and material phenomena derived from the four great essentials.
 These two constitute eleven categories. 
^bb#603^z3(In Detail: Concretely Produced Matter) ^n604 How? 1. Essential material phenomena: the earth element, the water element, the fire element, and the air element.
^n605 2. Sensitive material phenomena: eye, ear, nose, tongue, and body.
^n606 3. Objective material phenomena: visible form, sound, smell, taste, and tangibility, the latter consisting of three essentials excluding the water element.
^n607 4. Material phenomena of sex: femininity and masculinity.
^n608 5. Material phenomena of the heart: the heart-base. 
^n609 6. Material phenomena of life: the life faculty.
^n610 7. Material phenomena of nutriment: edible food.
^n611 Thus, these eighteen kinds of material phenomena are grouped together as: matter possessing intrinsic nature, matter possessing real characteristics, concretely produced matter, material matter, and matter to be comprehended by insight.
Non-Concretely Produced Matter	^bb#604^z3(In Detail: Non-Concretely Produced Matter) ^n612 8. Limiting material phenomenon: the element of space.
^n613 9. Intimating material phenomena: bodily intimation and vocal intimation. 
^n614 10. Mutable material phenomena: material lightness, malleability, wieldiness, and the two forms of intimation.
^n615 11. Characteristics of material phenomena: material production, continuity, decay, and impermanence.
^n616 Here, by production and continuity are meant the material phenomenon of birth.
^bb#605^z3(Twenty-eight Kinds of Matter) Thus, the eleven kinds of material phenomena are treated as twenty-eight according to their specific properties.
^n617 How (twenty-eight)? 
Essentials, sensory organs, objects, sex, heart,
 life, and nutriment — thus, concrete matter is eighteenfold. 
Limitation (space), intimation, mutability, and characteristics —
 thus, there are ten that are not concretely produced. In all, there are twenty-eight. 
Herein, this is the enumeration of matter. 
Classification of Matter	^z2(Classification of Matter) ^bb#606  ^z3(As Singlefold) ^n618 Now, all this matter is singlefold in so far as it is all: rootless, with conditions, subject to taints, conditioned, mundane, pertaining to the sense-sphere, objectless, not to be abandoned.
 However, when conceived as internal and external, etc., matter becomes manifold. 
^bb#607^z3(As Manifold) ^n619 How? The five kinds of sensitive material phenomena are internal; the rest are external. 
^n620 The six kinds, comprising the sensitive organs and the heart, are material phenomena that are bases; the rest are not bases. 
^n621 The seven kinds, comprising the sensitive organs and (the two) media of intimation, are material phenomena that are doors; the rest are not doors. 
^n622 The eight kinds, comprising the sensitive organs, sex states, and life, are material phenomena that are faculties; the rest are not faculties. 
^n623 The twelve kinds, comprising the five sensitive organs and (seven) sense groups, are gross, proximate, and impinging material phenomena; the rest are subtle, distant, and non-impinging. 
^n624 Material phenomena born of kamma are “clung-to”; the others are “not clung-to.”
^n625 The visible form base is visible; the rest are non-visible. 
^n626 Eye and ear, as not reaching (their object), and nose, tongue, and body, as reaching (their object), are five kinds of material phenomena that take objects; the others are material phenomena that do not take objects. 
^n627 Color, odor, taste, nutritive essence, and the four essentials are the eight kinds of material phenomena that are inseparable; the rest are separable. 
^bb#608^z3(Summary) ^n628 Thus, the wise analyze in a fitting way the twenty-eight kinds of matter
 with respect to such divisions as the internal and so forth. 
Herein, this is the classification of matter. 
The Origination of Matter	^z2(The Origination of Matter) ^bb#609 ^z3(The Four Modes of Origin) ^n629 Material phenomena originate in four ways: from kamma, from consciousness, from temperature, and from nutriment. 
^bb#610^z4(Kamma as a Mode of Origin) ^n630 Therein, the twenty-five kinds of wholesome and unwholesome kamma pertaining to the sense sphere and the fine-material sphere produce, in one’s internal continuum, volitionally conditioned material phenomena originating from kamma, moment by moment beginning with rebirth-linking. 
^bb#611^z4(Consciousness as a Mode of Origin) ^n631 The seventy-five types of consciousness, excluding the immaterial-sphere resultants and the two sets of fivefold sense consciousness,
 produce material phenomena originating from consciousness beginning with the first moment of the life-continuum (bhavanga), but they do so only (at the moment of) arising. 
^n632 Therein, the javanas of absorption also uphold the bodily postures.
^n633 But the determining consciousness, javanas of the sense sphere, and direct-knowledge consciousness produce also (bodily and vocal) intimation.
^n634 Herein, the thirteen javanas accompanied by joy produce smiling also. 
^bb#612^z4(Temperature as a Mode of Origin) ^n635The fire element, which comprises both cold and heat, on reaching its stage of presence, produces, according to circumstances, both internal and external material phenomena originating from temperature. 
^bb#613^z4(Nutriment as a Mode of Origin) ^n636 Nutriment, known as “nutritive essence,” on reaching its stage of presence, produces material phenomena originating from nutriment at the time it is swallowed. 
^bb#614^z3(Analysis by Way of Origins) ^n637 Therein, the material phenomena of the heart and the (eight) faculties are born of kamma.
^n638 The two media of intimation are born only of consciousness.
^n639 Sound is born of consciousness and temperature.
^n640 The triple qualities of lightness, (malleability, and wieldiness) arise from temperature, consciousness, and nutriment.
^n641 The inseparable material phenomena and the element of space arise from four causes.
^n642 Characteristic material phenomena do not arise from any cause. 
^bb#615^z3(Summary) ^n643 Eighteen, fifteen, thirteen, and twelve
 arise respectively from kamma, consciousness, temperature, and nutriment. 
^n644 It is explained that the characteristics (of material phenomena) are not produced by any (modes of origin)
 since their intrinsic nature (sabhāva) consists solely in the qualities of being produced, etc. 
Herein, this is the origination of matter. 
Groups	^bb#616^z2(his is the origination of matter)  ^z3(In Brief) ^n645 There are twenty-one material groups, inasmuch as they arise together, cease together, have a common basis, and occur together. 
^bb#617^z3(Groups Originating from Kamma) ^n646 Therein, life and the (eight) inseparable material phenomena together with the eye are called the “eye decad.”
 Similarly, (by joining the former nine) together with the ear and so forth, the ear decad, nose decad, tongue decad, body decad, female decade, male decad, (heart-)base decad, should respectively be formed.
 Inseparable material phenomena, together with life, are called the “vital nonad.”
 These nine groups originate from kamma. 
^bb#618^z3(Groups Originating from Consciousness) ^n647 The inseparable material phenomena constitute the “pure octad.”
 They, together with bodily intimation, constitute the bodily intimation nonad;
 together with vocal intimation and sound, the vocal intimation decad;
 together with the material phenomena of the lightness triad, the unidecad of the lightness triad;
 the dodecad of bodily intimation and the lightness triad;
 and the tridecad of vocal intimation, sound, and the lightness triad.
 These six material groups originate from consciousness. 
^bb#619^z3(Groups Originating from Temperature) ^n648 The pure octad, the sound nonad, the unidecad of the lightness triad; the dodecad of sound and the lightness triad — these four originate from temperature. 
^bb#620^z3(Groups Originating from Nutriment) ^n649 The pure octad and the unidecad of the lightness triad are the two material groups that originate from nutriment.
^bb#621^z3(he Internal and External) ^n650 Of them, the two material groups produced by temperature — the pure octad and the sound nonad — are found externally too.
 All the rest are strictly internal. 
^bb#622^z3(Summary) ^n651 There are twenty-one material groups — nine, six, four, and two — produced in due order from kamma, consciousness, temperature, and nutriment. 

As space demarcates, and the characteristic marks just indicate,
 the wise state that they are not constituents of material groups.
Herein, this is the grouping of material phenomena. 
Grouping	^bb#623 ^z2( this is the grouping of material phenomena.) ^z3(In the Sensory World) ^n652 All these material phenomena are obtained with no deficiency, according to circumstances, during the course of existence in the sensory world.
^n653 But, at rebirth-linking, to moisture-born beings and to those of spontaneous birth, there arise, at most, the seven decads — the decads of eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, sex, and the heart-base.
 As a minimum, sometimes the eye, ear, nose, and sex decads are not obtained.
 This is how deficiencies of material groups should be understood.
^n654 To the womb-born creatures, there arise (at rebirth) three decads — the decads of body, sex, and the heart-base.
 Sometimes, however, the sex decad is not obtained. 
Thereafter, during the course of existence, gradually there arise the eye decad and so forth. 
^bb#624^z4(The Continuity of Occurrence) ^n655 Thus, the continuity of material groups produced in four ways — namely, kamma-born from the time of rebirth-linking, consciousness-born from the second moment of consciousness, temperature-born from the time of the stage of presence, and nutriment-born from the time of diffusion of nutritive essence — uninterruptedly flows on in the sense sphere until the end of life, like the flame of a lamp or the stream of a river. 
^bb#625^z4(At the Time of Death) ^n656 But, at the time of death, kamma-born material phenomena no longer arise starting with the stage of presence of the seventeenth consciousness preceding the death of consciousness.
 Kamma-born material phenomena that arose earlier occur till the death-moment and then cease.
 Following that, the consciousness-born and nutriment-born material phenomena come to cessation.
Thereafter, a continuity of material qualities by temperature persists in the form of the corpse.
^bb#626  Verse ^n657 Thus, to the deceased beings, again in a subsequent life,
 material phenomena arise, starting from the rebirth-linking in the same way. 
Fine-Material World	^bb#627^z3(In the Fine-Material World) ^n658 In the fine-material world, the decads of nose, tongue, body, sex, and the material groups produced by nutriment are not found.
 Therefore, to those beings, at the time of rebirth-linking, there arise four material groups produced by kamma — the three decads of eye, ear, and heart-base, and the vital nonad.
 During the course of existence, material phenomena produced by consciousness and by temperature are found. 
^bb#628^z3(Among Non-Percipient Beings) ^n659 Among the non-percipient beings, the eye, ear, heart-base, and sound are also not found.
 Similarly, no consciousness-born material phenomena are found.
 Therefore, at the moment of their rebirth-linking, only the vital nonad arises.
 During the course of existence, material phenomena produced by temperature, with the exception of sound, continue. 
^bb#629^z3(Summary) ^n660 Thus, in the three cases of the sensory world, the fine-material world, and non-percipient beings, the occurrence of material phenomena should be understood as twofold, by way of rebirth-linking and the course of existence. 
^n661 In the sense planes, twenty-eight material phenomena are found; in the fine-material planes, twenty-three;
 among the non-percipients, seventeen; but none in the immaterial plane. 
At the moment of conception, sound, mutability, decay, and death are not found. 
In the course of existence, there is nothing that is not obtained. 
Herein, this is the procedure regarding the occurrence of material phenomena. 
Nibbana	^z2(Nibbāna)^bb#630  Definition^n662 Nibbāna is termed “supramundane” and is to be realized by the knowledge of the four paths (catumaggañāṇa).
 It becomes an object to the paths and its fruits and is called “Nibbāna” because it is a departure from craving, which is entanglement.
^bb#631^z3(Analysis) ^n663 Though Nibbāna is onefold according to its intrinsic nature, by reference to the basis (for distinction), it is twofold, namely, the element of Nibbāna with the residue remaining, and the element of Nibbāna without the residue remaining.
^n664 It is threefold according to its different aspects, namely, void, signless, and desireless. 
^bb#632^z3(Summary) ^n665^n700 Great seers who are free from craving declare that
 Nibbāna is an objective state which is deathless, absolutely endless, unconditioned, and unsurpassed. 
Thus, as fourfold, the Tathāgatas reveal the ultimate realities —
 consciousness (citta), mental factors (cetasika), matter (rūpa), and Nibbāna. 
^h(Thus ends the sixth chapter)
 in the Manual of Abhidhamma entitled “The Compendium of Matter.” 
Categories	^ck#aas7^z1(Compendium of Categories) ^bb#701^z2(Introductory Verse) ^n701 The seventy-two kinds of entities have (already) been described, together with their characteristics.
 Now, I will speak of their categories in the ways that are applicable. 
^bb#702^z2(Enumeration of Categories) ^n702 ^paste 1. The compendium of the unwholesome;
2. The compendium of mixed categories;
3. The compendium of requisites of enlightenment; and
4. The compendium of the whole.
^cut｛The compendium of categories should be understood as fourfold: ｝
Enumeration of Unwholesome	^z2(Enumeration of the Unwholesome) ^bb#703^z3(Taints) ^n703 How? First, in the compendium of the unwholesome (akusala), there are four taints (āsava): (1) the taint of sensory desire (kāmāsava); (2) the taint of (attachment to) existence (bhavāsava); (3) the taint of wrong views (diṭṭhāsava); and (4) the taint of ignorance (avijjāsava).
^bb#704^z3(Floods) ^n704 There are four floods (ogha): (1) the flood of sensory desire (kāmogha); (2) the flood of (attachment to) existence (bhavogha); (3) the flood of wrong views (di ṭṭhogha); and (4) the flood of ignorance (avijjogha). 
^bb#705^z3(Bonds) ^n705 There are four bonds (yoga): (1) the bond of sensory desire (kāmayoga); (2) the bond of (attachment to) existence (bhavayoga); (3) the bond of wrong views (di ṭṭhiyoga); and (4) the bond of ignorance (avijjāyoga). 
^bb#706^z3(Bodily Knots) ^n706 There are four bodily knots (gantha): (1) the bodily knot of covetousness (abhijjhā); (2) the bodily know of ill will (vyāpāda); (3) the bodily knot of adherence to rites and ceremonies (sīlabbataparāmāsa); and (4) the bodily knot of dogmatic belief that “this alone is the truth” (idaṁsaccābhinivesa). 
^bb#707^z3(Clingings) ^n707 There are four clingings (upādāna): (1) clinging to sense pleasure (kāmupādāna); (2) clinging to wrong views (d iṭṭhupādāna); (3) clinging to rites and ceremonies (sīlabbatupād;ānaan)d (4) clinging to a doctrine of self (atta vādupādāna).
^bb#708^z3(Hindrances) ^n708 There are six hindrances (nīvaraṇa): the hindrance of (1) desire for gratification of the senses (kāmacchanda); (2) ill will (vyāpāda); (3) sloth and torpor (thīna-middha); 
(4) restlessness and worry (udhacca-kukkucca); (5) doubt (vicikicchā); and (6) ignorance (avijjā). 
^bb#709^z3(Latent Dispositions) ^n709 There are seven latent dispositions (anusaya): the latent dispositions to (1) sensory lust (kāmarāga); (2) attachment to existence (bhavarāga); (3) aversion (paṭigha);
 (4) conceit (māna); (5) wrong views (di ṭṭhi); (6) doubt (vicikicchā); and (7) ignorance (avijjā). 
^bb#710^z3(Fetters (Suttanta Method)) ^n710 There are ten fetters (saṁyojana), according to the Suttanta method: the fetters of: (1) desire for gratification of the senses (sensory lust) (kāmarāga); (2) attachment to fine-material existence (rūparāga); (3) attachment to immaterial existence (arūparāga);(4) aversion (paṭigha);
 (5) conceit (māna); (6) wrong views (diṭṭhi); (7) adherence to rites and ceremonies (rites and rituals) (sīlabbataparāmāsa); (8) doubt (vicikicchā); (9) restlessness (uddhacca); and (10) ignorance (avijjā).
^bb#711^z3(Fetters (Abhidhamma Method)) ^n711 There are another ten fetters, according to the Abhidhamma method: the fetters of: (1) desire for gratification of the senses (sensory lust); (2) attachment to existence;(3) aversion;
 (4) conceit; (5) wrong views; (6) adherence to rites and ceremonies (rites and rituals); (7) doubt; (8) envy; (9) avarice; and (10) ignorance.
^bb#712^z3(Defilements) ^n712 There are ten defilements (kilesa): (1) greed (lobha); (2) hatred (dosa); (3) delusion (moha); (4) conceit (māna); (5) wrong views (diṭṭhi); (6) doubt (vicikkicchā);(7) sloth (thīna); (8) restlessness (uddhacca); (9) shamelessness (ahirika); and (10) fearlessness of wrongdoing (anottappa).
^bb#713^z3(A Clarification) ^n713 Herein, among the taints (āsava), it is craving (taṇhā) that is intended by the terms “sensory desire” (kāmataṇhā) and “(attachment to) existence” (bhavataṇhā), since it has them (that is, desire for gratification of the senses and existence) as its basis.
 It is wrong view (di ṭṭhi) that is spoken of as “adherence to rites and ceremonies,” “the dogmatic belief that ‘this alone is truth’,” and “clinging to a doctrine of self,” because it occurs in such modes. 
^bb#714^z3(Summary) ^n714 By way of entity, the taints, floods, bonds,
 and knots are threefold.
 There are two kinds of clinging spoken of
 and eight hindrances. 
The latent dispositions are only six, and the fetters can be understood as nine.
 The defilements are ten. Thus, the compendium of evil is stated as ninefold. 
Mixed	^bb#715^z2(Compendium of Mixed Categories)^z3(Roots) ^n715 In the compendium of mixed categories (missaka), there are six roots (hetu): (1) greed (lobha); (2) hatred (dosa); (3) delusion (moha); (4) non-greed (alobha); (5) non-hatred (adosa); and (6) non-delusion (amoha). 
^bb#716^z3(Jhāna Factors) ^n716 There are seven jhāna factors: (1) initial application (vitakka); (2) sustained application (vicāra); (3) zest (pīti); (4) one-pointedness (ekaggatā); (5) joy (somanassa); (6) displeasure (domanassa); and (7) equanimity (upekkhā).
^bb#717^z3(Path Factors) ^n717 There are twelve path factors ( magganga): (1) right view (sammādi ṭṭhi); (2) right intention (sammāsankappa); (3) right speech (sammāvācā); (4) right action (sammākammanta); (5) right livelihood (sammā-ājiva); (6) right effort (sammāvāyāma); 
(7) right mindfulness (sammāsati); (8) right concentration (sammāsamādhi); (9) wrong view (micchādi ṭṭhi); (10) wrong intention (micchāsankappa); (11) wrong effort (micchā-vāyāma); and (12) wrong concentration (micchāsamādhi). 
^bb#718  Faculties ^n718 There are twenty-two faculties (indriya): (1) the eye faculty (cakkhu); (2) the ear faculty (sota); (3) the nose faculty (ghāna); (4) the tongue faculty (jivhā); (5) the body faculty (kāya); (6) the femininity faculty (itthi); (7) the masculinity faculty (purisa); (8) the life faculty (jīvita); (9) the mind faculty (mana);
 (10) the pleasure faculty (sukha);(11) the pain faculty (dukkha); (12) the joy faculty (somanassa); (13) the displeasure faculty (domanassa); (14) the equanimity faculty (upekkhā); (15) the faith faculty (saddhā); (16) the energy faculty (viriya); (17) the mindfulness faculty (sati); (18) the concentration faculty (samādhi); (19) the wisdom faculty (paññā);
 (20) the “I will know the unknown” faculty (anaññātaññassāmītindriya); (21) the faculty of final knowledge (aññindriya); and (22) the faculty of one who has final knowledge (aññātāvindriya). 
^bb#719^z3(Powers) ^n719 There are nine powers (bala): (1) the power of faith (saddhā); (2) the power of energy (viriya); (3) the power of mindfulness (sati); (4) the power of concentration (samādhi); (5) the power of wisdom (paññā); (6) the power of shame (hiri); (7) the power of fear of wrongdoing (ottappa); (8) the power of shamelessness (ahiri); and (9) the power of fearlessness of wrongdoing (anottappa). 
^bb#720^z3(Predominants) ^n720 There are four predominants (adhipati): (1) predominance of desire (chanda); (2) predominance of energy (viriya); (3) predominance of consciousness (citta); and (4) predominance of investigation (vīmaṁsā). 
^bb#721^z3(Nutriments) ^n721 There are four nutriments (āhāra): (1) edible food (kabalīkāra / kabalinkāra); (2) contact (phassa) as the second; (3) mental volition (manosañcetanā) as the third; and (4) consciousness (viññāṇa) as the fourth. 
^bb#722^z3(Clarifications) ^n722 Herein, among the faculties, it is explained that the faculty “I will know the unknown” is the knowledge of the path of stream-entry (sotāpatti);
^n723  the faculty of one who has final knowledge is the knowledge of the fruit of Arahatship;
^n724 the faculty of final knowledge is the six intermediate kinds of (supramundane) knowledge.
^n725 The life faculty is twofold — physical and mental. 
^n726  The jhāna factors are not found in the fivefold sense consciousness, the powers in those (kinds of consciousness) that are without energy, or the path factors in those that are rootless.
^n727 So too, in the consciousness accompanied by doubt, one-pointedness does not attain to the stature of a path factor, a faculty, or a power.
^n728 Only one predominant is obtained at a time, according to circumstances, and only in javanas with two roots and three roots. 
^bb#723^z3(Summary) ^n729 By way of entity, six roots, five jhāna factors, nine path factors,
 sixteen faculties, and nine powers have been described. 
Likewise, four predominants have been stated and four nutriments.
 Thus, the compendium of mixed categories, consisting of a combination of wholesome states and the rest, has been stated in seven ways.
Requisites of Enlightenment	^bb#724^z2(Four Foundations of Mindfulness)^z3(Four Foundations of Mindfulness) ^n730 In the compendium of requisites of enlightenment, there are four foundations of mindfulness (satipaṭṭhāna): (1) the foundation of mindfulness in contemplation of the body; (2) the foundation of mindfulness in contemplation of feelings; (3) the foundation of mindfulness in contemplation of consciousness; and (4) the foundation of mindfulness in contemplation of mental objects. 
^bb#725^z3(Four Supreme Efforts) ^n731 There are four supreme efforts (sammappadhāna): (1) the effort to abandon unwholesome mental states that have already arisen; (2) the effort to prevent unarisen unwholesome mental states from arising; (3) the effort to develop wholesome mental states that have not yet arisen; and (4) the effort to maintain and perfect wholesome mental states that have already arisen. 
^bb#726^z3(Four Means to Accomplishment) ^n732 There are four means to accomplishment (iddhipāda): the means to accomplish- ment consisting of: (1) desire (chanda); (2) energy (viriya); (3) consciousness (citta); and (4) investigation (vīmaṁsā).
^bb#727^z3(Five Faculties) ^n733 There are five faculties (indriya): the faculties of: (1) faith (saddhā); (2) energy (viriya); (3) mindfulness (sati); (4) concentration (samādhi); and (5) wisdom (paññā). 
^bb#728^z3(Five Powers) ^n734 There are five powers (bala): the powers of: (1) faith (saddhā); (2) energy (viriya); (3) mindfulness (sati); (4) concentration (samādhi); and (5) wisdom (paññā). 
^bb#729^z3(Seven Factors of Enlightenment) ^n735 There are seven factors of enlightenment (bojjhanga): (1) mindfulness (sati- sambojjhanga); (2) investigation of the truth (dhamma-vicaya); (3) energy / effort (viriya); (4) zest / bliss / joy / rapture (pīti); (5) tranquility (passaddhi); (6) concentration (samādhi); and (7) equanimity (upekkhā). 
^bb#730^z3(Eight Path Factors) ^n736 There are eight path factors (magganga): (1) right view (sammādi ṭṭhi); (2) right intention (sammāsankappa); (3) right speech (sammāvācā); (4) right action (sammā-kammanta); (5) right livelihood (sammā-ājīva); (6) right effort (sammāvāyāma); (7) right mindfulness (sammāsati); and (8) right concentration (sammāsamādhi). 
^bb#731^z3(A Clarification) ^n737 Here, by the four foundations of mindfulness, right mindfulness alone is implied. 
^n738 Similarly, by the four supreme efforts, right effort is implied. 
^bb#732^z3(By Way of States) ^n739 ^paste desire; consciousness; equanimity; faith; tranquility; zest;
 right view; intention; effort; the three abstinences;
 right mindfulness; and concentration. 
^cut｛The sevenfold compendium of the thirty-seven factors is composed of these fourteen states considered by way of their intrinsic nature:｝
^bb#733^z3(By Way of Occurrence) ^n740 The analysis of these thirty-seven excellent factors is as follows: nine (intention, tranquility, zest, equanimity,
 desire, consciousness, and the three abstinences)
 occur only once each; energy occurs nine times;
 mindfulness eight times; concentration four times; wisdom four times;
 and faith two times. 
^n741 All these occur in the supramundane except,
 at times, intention and zest.
 In the mundane, too, they occur in the course of the sixfold purification, according to circumstances. 
Whole	^bb#734^z2(Compendium of the Whole) ^z3(The Five Aggregates) ^n742 In the compendium of the whole, there are five aggregates (khandha):^f110 (1) the aggregate of form / corporeality / materiality (rūpa); (2) the aggregate of feeling (vedanā); (3) the aggregate of perception (saññā); (4) the aggregate of (predisposing) mental formations (saṁkhāra); and (5) the aggregate of consciousness (viññāṇa). 
^bb#735^z3(The Five Aggregates of Clinging) ^n743 There are five aggregates of clinging (upādānakkhandha): (1) the materiality aggregate of clinging (rūpupādānakkhandha); (2) the feeling aggregate of clinging (vedanupādānakkhandha); (3) the perception aggregate of clinging (saññupādāna- kkhandha); (4) the (predisposing) mental formations aggregate of clinging (saṁkhārupā- dānakkhandha); and (5) the consciousness aggregate of clinging (viññāṇupādāna- kkhandha).
 ^bb#736^z3(The Twelve Sense Bases) ^n744 There are twelve sense bases (āyatana): (1) the eye (cakkhu) base; (2) the ear (sota) base; (3) the nose (ghāna) base; (4) the tongue (jivhā) base; (5) the body (kāya) base; (6) the mind (mana) base;
 (7) the visible form (rūpa) base; (8) the sound (sadda) base; (9) the smell (gandha) base; (10) the taste (rasa) base; (11) the tangible (pho ṭṭhabba) base; and (12) the mental-object (dhamma) base. 
^bb#737^z3(The Eighteen Elements) ^n745 There are eighteen elements (dhātu): (1) the eye element; (2) the ear element; (3) the nose element; (4) the tongue element; (5) the body element;
 (6) the visible form element; (7) the sound element; (8) the smell element; (9) the taste element; (10) the tangible element;
 (11) the eye-consciousness element; (12) the ear-consciousness element; (13) the nose-consciousness element; (14) the tongue-consciousness element; (15) the body-consciousness element;
 (16) the mind element; (17) the mental-object element; and (18) the mind-consciousness element.
Four Noble Truths	^bb#738^z3(The Four Noble Truths) ^n746The Four Noble Truths (ariyasacca) are: (1) the noble truth of suffering (dukkha);
 (2) the noble truth of the origin (samudaya) of suffering;
 (3) the noble truth of the cessation (nirodha) of suffering;
 and (4) the noble truth of the path (pa ṭipadā) leading to the cessation of suffering. 
^bb#739^z3(A Clarification) ^n747Herein, sixty-nine states comprising (fifty-two) mental factors, (sixteen kinds of) subtle matter, and nibbāna, are regarded as the mental-object base and the mental-object element.
^n748 The mind base itself is divided into the seven elements of consciousness. 
^bb#740^z3(Summary) ^n749 Matter, feeling, perception, the remaining mental factors,
 and consciousness — these five are called the “five aggregates.” 
^n750 The same states that pertain to the three (mundane) planes are regarded as the five aggregates of clinging. 
Inasmuch as nibbāna lacks differentiation (such as past, present, future), it is excluded from the category of aggregates. 
^n751 Owing to the difference between doors and objects, there are (twelve) sense bases.
 In accordance with doors, objects, and their corresponding consciousness, the (eighteen) elements arise. 
^n752 The round of existence in the three planes is suffering. Craving is its origin.
Cessation is nibbāna. The (Noble Eightfold) Path is regarded as supramundane. 
^n753^n800 Mental states associated with the paths and the fruits are excluded from the four ^i(truths.)
Thus, the Compendium of the Whole has been explained in five ways. 
Thus ends the seventh chapter
in the Manual of Abhidhamma entitled “The Compendium of Categories.”
Conditionality	^ck#aas8^z1(Compendium of Conditionality)^bb#801  ^z2(Introductory Verse) ^n801 I shall now explain here, in a fitting manner, the detailed analysis of the conditioned states,
 and of those states that are their conditions, and of how (they are related). 
^bb#802^z2(In Brief): The Two Methods ^n802 ^paste 1. The method of dependent arising (paṭiccasamuppāda);
2. The method of conditional relations (paṭṭhāna).
^cut｛The compendium of conditionality is twofold: ｝
^n803 Of these, the method of dependent arising is marked by the simple happening of a state of dependence on some other state.
 The method of conditional relations is discussed with reference to the specific causal efficacy of the conditions.
 Teachers explain them by mixing both methods.
Basic Formula	^bb#803^z2(The Basic Formula) ^n804 Therein: 1. Dependent upon ignorance (avijjā), karmic formations arise;
2. Dependent upon karmic formations (saṁkhāra), consciousness arises;
3. Dependent upon consciousness (viññāṇa), mind-and-matter arise;
4. Dependent upon mind-and-matter (nāmarūpa), the six sense bases arise;
5. Dependent upon the six sense bases (saḷāyatana), contact arises;
6. Dependent upon contact (phassa), feeling arises;
7. Dependent upon feeling (vedanā), craving arises;
8. Dependent upon craving (taṇhā), clinging arises;
9. Dependent upon clinging (upādāna), existence arises;
10. Dependent upon existence (bhava), birth arises;
11. Dependent upon birth (jāti), decay and death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief, and despair (jarāmaraṇa-soka-parideva-dukkha-domass’-upāyāsā) arise.
Thus arises the whole mass of suffering. 
Herein, this is the method of dependent arising. 
Analysis of Conditionality	^bb#804^z3(Categories of Analysis) ^n805 It should be understood that there are three periods (addhā), twelve factors (anga), twenty modes (ākāra), three connections (sandhi), four groups (sankhepa), three rounds (va ṭṭa), and two roots (mūla). 
^bb#805  The Three Periods ^n806 How? Ignorance (avijjā) and karmic formations (saṁkhārā) belong to the past;
 birth (jāti) and decay-and-death (jarāmaraṇa) belong to the future;
 the intermediate eight factors belong to the present.
 Thus, there are three periods (addhā). 
^bb#806^z3(The Twelve Factors) ^n807 (1) Ignorance (avijjā); (2) karmic formations (saṁkhārā); (3) consciousness (viññāṇa); (4) mind-and-matter (nāma-rūpa); (5) the six sense bases (saḷāyatana); (6) contact (phassa); (7) feeling (vedanā); (8) craving (taṇhā); (9) clinging (upādāna); (10) existence (bhava); (11) birth (jāti); and (12) decay-and-death (jarāmaraṇa) are the twelve factors (dvādas’angāni).
^n808 The terms sorrow and so on are shown as incidental consequences (of birth). 
^bb#807^z3(The Four Groups) ^n809 Here, by taking ignorance and karmic formations, craving, clinging, and existence are also taken.
 Likewise, by taking craving, clinging, and existence, ignorance and karmic formations are also taken.
 By taking birth and decay-and-death, the five effects — consciousness and so on — are also taken.
^n810 Thus, there are: (1) Five causes pertaining to the past;(2) And five effects to the present;
(3) Five causes pertaining to the present; (4) And five effects to the future.
There are twenty modes, three connections, and four groups. 
^bb#808^z3(The Three Rounds) ^n811 ^paste 1. Ignorance (avijjā), craving (taṇhā), and clinging (upādāna) belong to the round of defilements (kilesa);
2. One part of existence (bhava) known as “karmic existence” and “karmic formations” (saṁkhārā) belong to the round of kamma;
3. One part of existence known as “rebirth existence” (upapattibhava) and the rest belong to the round of results (vipāka).
^cut｛The three rounds (vaṭṭa): ｝
^bb#809^z3(The Two Roots) ^n812 Ignorance and craving should be understood as the two roots. 
^bb#810^z3(Summary) ^n813 By the destruction of these roots (mūla), the round (vaṭṭa) ceases.
 With the arising of the taints (āsava) in those who are constantly oppressed (pīḷita) by infatuation (mucchā) with decay and death (jarāmaraṇa), ignorance again occurs.

The Great Sage (mahāmuni) has thus expounded this entangled, beginningless round of becoming with its three planes as “dependent arising” (pa ṭiccasamuppa).

Twenty-four Conditions	^bb#811^z2(The Twenty-four Condition) ^z3(The Twenty-four Conditions) ^n814 ^paste (1) root (hetu) condition; (2) object (ārammaṇa) condition; (3) predominance (adhipati) condition;
 (4) proximity (anantara) condition; (5) contiguity (samanantara) condition;
 (6) conascence (sahajāta) condition; (7) mutuality (aññamañña) condition;
 (8) support (nissaya) condition; (9) decisive (upanissaya) condition;
 (10) prenascence (purejāta) condition; (11) post-nascence (pacchājāta) condition;
 (12) repetition (āsevana) condition; (13) kamma condition; (14) result (vipāka) condition;
 (15) nutriment (āhāra) condition; (16) faculty (indriya) condition;
 (17) jhāna condition; (18) path (magga) condition;
 (19) association (sampayutta) condition; (20) dissociation (vippayutta) condition;
 (21) presence (atthi) condition; (22) absence (natthi) condition;
 (23) disappearance (vigata) condition; and (24) non-disappearance (avigata) condition. 
^cut｛The following is the method of conditional relations (paṭṭhāna):｝
Application of Conditions	^bb#812^z3(Application in Brief) ^n815 In six ways, mind (nāma) is a condition (paccaya) for mind.
 In five ways, mind is a condition for mind-and-matter (nāmarūpa).
 Again, mind is a condition in one way for matter (rūpa), and matter in one way for mind.
 In two ways, concepts (paññatti) and mind-and-matter are a condition for mind.
 In nine ways, the dyad — mind-and-matter — is a condition for mind-and-matter.
 Thus, the relations are sixfold. How?

Conascent volition (cetanā) is a condition for conascent mind-and-matter,
 and asynchronous volition for mind-and-matter born of kamma, by way of kamma. 
The (mental) resultant aggregates (vipākakkhandhā) are a condition for one another and for conascent matter by way of result (vipāka). 
^cut｛In five ways, mind (nāma) is a condition for mind-and-matter (nāmarūpa): ｝

^bb#816^z4(Matter for Mind) ^n819 Only in one way is matter a condition for mind: the six bases (vatthu), during the course of existence, are a condition for the seven elements of consciousness (viññāṇa- dhātu), and the five objects (ālambana) for the five processes (vīthi) of sense consciousness, by way of prenascence. 
^bb#817^z4(Mind-and-Matter for Mind) ^n820 In two ways, concepts (paññatti) and mind-and-matter (nāmarūpa) are conditions (paccaya) for mind (nāma) — namely, by way of object (ārammaṇa) and decisive support (upanissaya-paccaya).
^n821 Therein, object is sixfold as visible form, etc.
^n822 But decisive support is threefold, namely,
 object decisive support, proximity decisive support, and natural decisive support.
^n823  Of them, the object itself, when it becomes prominent,serves as object decisive support (ārammaṇūpanissaya).

Synthesis of Conditions	^bb#827^z3(The Synthesis of Conditions) ^n835 All conditions are included in the conditions of (1) object, (2) decisive support, (3) kamma, and (4) presence.
^n836 Herein, in all cases, conascent material phenomena should be understood as twofold: (1) throughout the course of existence, they should be understood as those born of consciousness,
 and (2), at rebirth-linking, as those born of kamma. 
^bb#828^z3(Summary) ^n837 Thus, the things pertaining to the three periods of time and timeless,
 internal and external, conditioned and unconditioned,
 are threefold by way of concepts, mind, and matter. 
In all, the conditions in the scheme of conditioned relations are twenty-four. 
Concepts	^z2(Analysis of Concepts) ^bb#829  In Brief ^n838 Therein, the material phenomena (rūpadhammā) are just the aggregate of matter (rūpakkhandha).
 Consciousness (citta) and mental factors (cetasika), which comprise the four immaterial aggregates,
 and Nibbāna, are the five kinds that are immaterial (arūpa).
 They are also called “name” (nāma). 
^n839 What remains are concepts (paññatti), which are twofold: (1) concept as that which is made known; and (2) concept as that which makes known. 
Made Known	^bb#830^z3(Concept as What is Made Known) ^n840 How? There are such terms as “land,” “mountain,” and the like, so designated on account of the mode of transition of the respective elements;
 such terms as “house,” “chariot,” “cart,” and the like, so named on account of the mode of formation of materials;
 such terms as “person,” “individual,” and the like, so named on account of the five aggregates;
 such terms as “direction,” “time,” and the like, named according to the revolution of the moon and so forth;
 such terms as “well,” “cave,” and the like, so named on account of the mode of non-impact and so forth;
 such terms as “kasiṇa signs” and the like, so named on account of respective elements and distinguishing mental development. 
All such different things, though they do not exist in the ultimate sense, become objects of consciousness in the form of shadows (chāyā) of (ultimate) things. 
They are called “concepts” because they are thought of, reckoned, understood, expressed, and made known on account of, in consideration of, with respect to, this or that mode.
 This kind of concept is so called because it is made known.
Makes Known	^bb#831^z3(Concept as What Makes Known) ^n841 Then, as it makes known, it is called “concept.” It is described as name, nomenclature, etc. 
^paste (1) a (direct) concept of the real; (2) a (direct) concept of the unreal;
 (3) a concept of the unreal by means of the real;
 (4) a concept of the real by means of the unreal;
 (5) a concept of the real by means of the real;
 and (6) a concept of the unreal by means of the unreal. 
^cut｛It is sixfold: ｝
^n842 As, for instance, when it makes known what really exists in the ultimate sense by a term,
 such as “land,” “mountain,” and so forth, it is called a “direct concept of the unreal.” 
The rest should be respectively understood by combining both as, for instance, “possessor of sixfold direct knowledge,” “woman’s voice,” “eye-consciousness,” and “king’s son.”
^bb#832^z3(Summary) ^n843^n900 By following the sound of speech through the process of ear-consciousness,
 and then by means of the concept conceived by (the process in the) mind-door that subsequently arises,
 meanings are understood.
 These concepts should be understood as fashioned by worldly conventions. 
Thus ends the eighth chapter
in the Manual of Abhidhamma entitled “The Compendium of Conditionality.” 
Meditation Subjects	^ck#aas9^z1(Compendium of Meditation Subjects)^bb#901^z2(Introductory Verse) ^n901 From this point on, I will explain, in order, the two types of meditation subject for the respective development of calm (samatha) and insight (vipassanā).

^cut｛ in the compendium of calm (samatha), first the compendium of meditation subjects (kammaṭṭhāna) of developing calm is sevenfold:｝
^bb#903^z4(Temperaments) ^n903 The compendium of temperaments (carita) is sixfold: (1) the lustful (rāga); (2) the hateful (dosa); (3) the deluded (moha); (4) the faithful (saddhā); (4) the intellectual (buddhi); and (6) the discursive (vitakka).
^bb#904^z4(Development) ^n904 ^paste (1) preliminary development (parikammabhāvanā);
 (2) access development^f128 (upacārabhāvanā); and
 (3) absorption development^f129 (appanābhāvanā). 
^cut｛The three stages of mental development (bhāvanā) are: ｝
Signs	^bb#905^z4(Signs) ^n905  (1) the preliminary sign^f131 (parikammanimitta);
 (2) the learning sign^f132 (uggahanimitta);
 and (3) the counterpart sign (pa ṭibhāganimitta).
^cut｛The three signs(nimitta) should be understood as:｝^f130
^bb#906^z4(The Kasiṇas) ^n906 How? ^paste (1) the earth kasiṇa (paṭhavīkasiṇa);
 (2) the water kasiṇa (āpokasiṇa);
 (3) the fire kasiṇa (tejokasiṇa);
 (4) the air kasiṇa (vāyokasiṇa);
 (5) the blue kasiṇa (nīlakasiṇa);

 (8) the white kasiṇa (odātakasiṇa);
 (9) the space kasiṇa (ākāsakasiṇa);
 and (10) the light kasiṇa (ālokakasiṇa).
^cut｛The ten kasiṇas are:｝
^bb#907^z4(Foulness) ^n907 ^paste (1) a bloated corpse (uddhumātaka);
 (2) a livid corpse (vinīlaka);
 (3) a festering corpse (vipubbaka)
; (4) a dismembered corpse (vicchiddaka);
 (5) an eaten corpse (vikkhāyitaka);

 (8) a bloody corpse (lohitaka );
 (9) a worm-infested corpse (puḷavaka);
 and (10) a skeleton ( aṭṭhika).
^cut｛The ten kinds of foulness (asubha) are: ｝
^bb#908^z4(The Recollections) ^n908 ^paste (1) the recollection of the Buddha (buddhānussati);
 (2) the recollection of the Dhamma (dhammānussati);
 (3) the recollection of the Sangha (sanghānussati);
 (4) the recollection of morality (sīlānussati);
 (5) the recollection of generosity (cāgānussati);

 (7) the recollection of peace (upasamānussati)
; (8) the recollection of death (maraṇānussati);
 (9) mindfulness occupied with the body (kāyagatāsati);
 and (10) mindfulness of breathing (ānāpānasati). 
^cut｛The ten recollections (anussati) are:｝^f135
^bb#909^z4(The Illimitables) ^n909 The four illimitables (appamañnā), also called “divine abodes” (brahmavihāra), are: (1) loving-kindness (mettā); (2) compassion (karuṇā); (3) appreciative joy (muditā); and (4) equanimity (upekkhā). 
^bb#910^z4(One Perception) ^n910 The one perception (saññā) is the perception of the loathsomeness of food (paṭikkūlasaññā).
^bb#911^z4(One Analysis) ^n911 The one analysis is the analysis of the four elements. 
^bb#912^z4(The Immaterial States) ^n912 The four immaterial states are the base of infinite space, and so forth.
 Thus, in the exposition of calm, there are altogether forty subjects of meditation.
Temperament	^bb#913^z4(According to Temperament) ^n913 With respect to temperaments (carita), the ten kinds of foulness and mindfulness occupied with the body, that is, meditation on the thirty-two repulsive parts, are suitable for those of a lustful temperament (rāgacarita). 
^n914 The four illimitables and the four colored kasiṇas are suitable for those of a hateful temperament (dosacarita). 
^n915 Mindfulness of breathing is suitable for those of a deluded temperament (moha- carita) as well as for those of a discursive temperament (vitakkacarita). 
^n916 The six recollections of the Buddha, and so forth, are suitable for those of a faithful temperament (saddhācarita). 
^n917 Recollection of death, of peace, of the perception of the loathsomeness of food, and the analysis of the four elements are suitable for those of an intellectual temperament (buddhicarita). 
^n918 All of the remaining subjects of meditation are suitable for all temperaments. 
Of the kasiṇas, a wide one is suitable for one of a deluded temperament (moha- carita), and a small one for one of a discursive temperament (vitakka-carita). 
Herein, this is the analysis by was of suitability. 
Development	^z3(Analysis of Development) ^bb#914  By Way of the Three Stages ^n919 The preliminary stage of development (parikammabhāvanā) is attainable in all forty of these meditation subjects (kamma ṭṭhāna).
 In ten meditation subjects — the eight recollections on the Buddha and so forth, the one perception, and the one analysis —, only access development (upacārabhāvanā) is attainable but not absorption.
^n920 In the thirty remaining meditation subjects, the absorption stage of development (appanābhāvanā) is also attainable. 
^bb#915^z4(By Way of Jhāna) ^n921 Therein, the ten kasiṇas and mindfulness of breathing produce five jhānas;
^n922  the ten foulnesses and mindfulness occupied with the body 〔only〕 the first jhāna;
^n923 the first three illimitables, such as loving-kindness, four jhānas;
^n924 equanimity, the fifth jhāna 〔only〕.
Thus, these twenty-six subjects of meditation produce fine-material-sphere jhānas. 
^n925 The four immaterial states produce immaterial jhānas. 
Herein, this is the analysis by way of development. 
^bb#916^z4(The Signs) ^n926  Of the three signs, the preliminary sign (parikammanimitta) and the learning sign (uggahanimitta) are generally found in relation to every object, in the appropriate way.
^n927 But the counterpart sign (paṭibhāganimitta) is found only in the kasi ṇas, foulness (asubha), the parts of the body, and mindfulness of breathing (ānāpānasati).
^n928 It is by means of the counterpart sign that access concentration (upacārasamādhi) and absorption concentration (appanāsamādhi) occur. 
^bb#917^z4(Appearance of the Signs in Meditation) ^n929 How? When a beginner (ādikammika) apprehends a particular sign (nimitta) from the earth disk (paṭhavīmaṇḍala), etc., that object is called the “preliminary sign” (parikammanimitta), and that meditation is called “preliminary development” (parikam- mabhāvanā). 
^n930 When that sign has been thoroughly apprehended and enters into range of the mind door (manodvāra) just as if it were seen by the eye, then it is called the “learning sign” (uggahanimitta), and that meditation becomes concentrated. 
 When one is thus concentrated, one then applies oneself to meditation by means of that preliminary concentration (parikammasamādhi) based on that learning sign.
 As one does so, an object that is the counterpart of the 〔learning sign〕 becomes well established and fixed in the mind — 〔an object〕 which is freed from the flaws of the original object, reckoned as a concept, born of meditation.
 Then, it is said that the counterpart sign (paṭibhāganimitta) has arisen. 
Jhanas	^bb#918^z4(Attainment of Jhānas)^n931 Thereafter, access development (upacārabhāvanā) is accomplished, consisting in concentration of the sense sphere, in which the obstacles have been abandoned.
^n932 Following this, as one cultivates the counterpart sign by means of access concentration, one enters the first jhāna of the fine-material sphere. 
^n933 Following this, one masters the first jhāna by means of the five kinds of mastery — in adverting, attainment, resolution, emergence, and reviewing.
 Then, by striving to abandon the successive gross factors such as initial application (vitakka), etc., and to arouse the successive subtle factors, such as sustained application (vicāra), etc., one enters the second jhāna, etc., in due order according to one’s ability. 
^n934 Thus, the counterpart sign is found in twenty-two meditation subjects — the earth kasiṇa, etc. —, but, of the remaining 〔eighteen〕 subjects,
^n935  the illimitables occur with the concept of beings 〔as their object〕. 
^bb#919^z4(The Immaterial Attainments)^n936 Next, one withdraws any kasiṇa except the space kasiṇa and does the preliminary work by contemplating the space that remains as infinite.
^n937 By doing so, one enters the first immaterial attainment. When one does the preliminary work by contemplating the first immaterial-sphere consciousness as infinite, one enters the second immaterial attainment.
^n938 When one does the preliminary work by contemplating the absence of the first immaterial-sphere consciousness thus, “there is nothing,” one enters the third immaterial attainment.
^n939 When one does the preliminary work by contemplating the third immaterial attainment thus, “this is peaceful, this is sublime,” one enters the fourth immaterial attainment.
^bb#920^z4(Other Meditation Subjects) ^n940 With the other ten meditation subjects, when one does the preliminary work by taking the virtues of the Buddha, etc., as one’s object, when that sign has been thoroughly acquired, one becomes concentrated upon it by means of preliminary development, and access concentration is also accomplished. 
Direct Knowledge	^bb#921^z4(Direct Knowledge) ^n941 Having emerged from the fifth jhāna taken as a basis for direct knowledge, having adverted to the resolution, etc., when one does the preliminary work, one enters into the fifth fine-material-sphere jhāna occurring by way of direct knowledge (abhiññā) with respect to such objects as visible form, etc. 
^n942 The direct knowledges are fivefold:
 (1) the supernormal powers;
 (2) the divine ear;
 (3) knowledge of others’ minds;
 (4) recollection of past lives;
 and (5) the divine eye. 
Herein, this is the analysis of the terrain (gocarabheda).
 The method of meditation for developing calm is finished. 

Insight	^bb#922^z2(Compendum of Insight) ^z3(Stages of Purification)^n943 In insight meditation (vipassanā),  ^paste
 (1) purification of virtue (sīlavisuddhi);
 (2) purification of mind (cittavisuddhi);
 (3) purification of view (diṭṭhivisuddhi);
 (4) purification by overcoming doubt (kankhāvitaraṇavisuddhi);
 (5) purification by knowledge and vision of what is the path and what is not the path (maggāmaggañāṇadassanavisuddhi);
 (6) purification by knowledge and vision of the way (paṭipadāñāṇadassanavisuddhi);
 and (7) purification by knowledge and vision (ñāṇadassanavisuddhi).
^cut｛the compendium of purification (visuddhi) is sevenfold:｝
^bb#923^z4(The Three Characteristics) ^n944 There are three characteristics (of existence) (lakkhaṇa): (1) the characteristic of impermanence (anicca); (2) of suffering (dukkha); and (3) of non-self (anattā).
^bb#924^z4(The Three Contemplations) ^n945 There are three contemplations (anupassanā): (1) the contemplation of impermanence (anicca); (2) the contemplation of suffering (dukkha); and (3) the contemplation of non-self (anattā).
Insight Knowlege	^bb#925^z4(The Ten Insight Knowledges) ^n946 ^paste (1) knowledge of comprehension (sammasanañāṇa);
 (2) knowledge of rise and fall (of formations) (udayabbayañāṇa);
 (3) knowledge of dissolution (of formations) (bhangañāṇa);
 (4) knowledge (of dissolving things) as fearful (bhayañāṇa);
 (5) knowledge of (fearful) things as dangerous (ādīnavañāṇa);
 (6) knowledge of disenchantment (with all formations) (nibbidāñāṇa);
 (7) knowledge of desire for deliverance (muñcitukamyatāñāṇa);
 (8) knowledge of reflective contemplation (paṭisankhāñāṇa);
 (9) knowledge of equanimity towards all formations (of existence) (saṁkhār’upekkhāñāṇa);
 and (10) knowledge of conformity (to truth) (anulomañāṇa).
^cut｛There are ten kinds of insight knowledge (vipassanāñāṇa):｝
^bb#926^z4(The Three Emancipations) ^n947 There are three emancipations (vimokkha): (1) the void emancipation (suññatā- vimokkha); (2) the signless emancipation (animitta-vimokkha); and (3) the desireless emancipation (appaṇihita-vimokkha). 
^bb#927^z4(The Three Doors to Emancipation) ^n948 There are three doors to emancipation (vimokkhamukha): (1) contemplation of the void (suññatānupassanā); (2) contemplation of the signless (animittānupassanā); and (3) contemplation of the desireless (appaṇihitānupassanā). 
Purification	^bb#928^z4(Purification of Virtue) ^n949 ^paste namely: 
1. Virtue regarding restraint according to the Pāṭimokkha;
2. Virtue regarding restraint of the sense faculties;
3. Virtue consisting of purity of livelihood; and
4. Virtue connected with the use of the requisites.
^cut｛Purification of virtue (sīlavisuddhi) consists of the four kinds of purified virtue,｝
^bb#929^z4(Purification of Mind) ^n950 Purification of mind (cittavisuddhi) consists of two kinds of concentration, namely, (1) access concentration (upacārasamādhi) and (2) absorption concentration (appanāsamādhi). 
^bb#930^z4(Purification of View) ^n951 Purification of view (diṭṭhivisuddhi) is the discernment of mind and matter (nāma-rūpapariggaha) with respect to their characteristics (lakkhaṇa), functions (rasa), manifestations (paccup aṭṭhāna), and proximate causes (padaṭṭhāna).
^bb#931^z4(Purification by Overcoming Doubt) ^n952 Purification by overcoming doubt (kankhāvitaraṇavisuddhi) is the discernment of the conditions (paccayapariggaha) of that same mind and matter. 
^bb#932^z4(Purification by Knowledge and Vision of What is the Path and What is not the Path) ^n953 When he has thus discerned the formations of the three planes together with their conditions, the meditator collects them into groups by way of such categories as the aggregates, etc., divided into the past 〔present, and future〕. 
He next comprehends, with the knowledge of comprehension, those formations in terms of the three characteristics — impermanence in the sense of destruction, suffering in the sense of fearfulness, and non-self in the sense of corelessness — by way of duration, continuity, and moment.
 Then, he contemplates, with the knowledge of rise and fall, the rising and falling 〔of those formations〕 by way of condition and by way of moment. 
As he does so, there arise: an aura (of light) (obhāsa), zest (pīti), tranquility (passaddhi), resolution (adhimokkha), exertion (paggaha),
 happiness (sukha), knowledge (ñāṇa), mindfulness (upaṭṭhāna^f148 ), equanimity (upekkhā), and attachment (nikanti). 
Purification by knowledge and vision of what is the path and what is not the path (maggāmaggañāṇadassanavisuddhi) is the discrimination of the characteristics of what is the path and what is not the path by discerning that those imperfections of insight — the aura, etc. — are obstacles to progress.
^bb#933^z4(Purification of the Way) ^n954 When he is thus free from those obstacles to progress, as he practices, he passes through a succession of insights in regard to the three characteristics, beginning with knowledge of rise and fall and culminating in conformity.
 These nine insight knowledges are called “purification by knowledge and vision of the way” (paṭipadāñāṇadassana- visuddhi). 
^bb#934^z4(Purification by Knowledge and Vision) ^n955 When he thus practices contemplation, owing to the ripening of insight 〔he feels〕,
 “Now the absorption 〔of the path〕 will arise.” Thereupon, arresting the life-continuum, there arises mind-door adverting,
 followed by two or three 〔moments of〕 insight consciousness, having for their object any of the characteristics such as impermanence, etc.
 They are termed “preparation,” “access,” and “conformity” 〔moments〕.
^n956 That knowledge of equanimity towards formations, together with knowledge that conforms 〔to the truths〕, when perfected, is also called “insight leading to emergence.” 
^n957 Thereafter, the change-of-lineage consciousness (gotrabhūcitta), having Nibbāna as its object, occurs, overwhelming the lineage of worldlings (puthujjjanagotta) and evolving the lineage of the noble ones (ariyagotta).
^n958 Immediately after this, the path 〔of stream-entry〕, fully understanding the truth of suffering (dukkhasacca), abandoning the truth of its origin (samudayasacca),
realizing the truth of its cessation (nirodhasacca),
 and developing the path (magga) to its cessation, enters upon the 〔supramundane〕 cognitive process of absorption.
^n959 After that, two or three moments of fruition consciousness (phalacitta) arise and cease. Then, there is subsidence into the life-continuum (bhavanga). 
Then, arresting the life-continuum, reviewing knowledge (paccavekkhaṇañāṇa) occurs.
^n960 The wise person reviews the path (magga), fruit (phala), Nibbāna, and he either reviews or does not review
 the defilements (kilesa) that have been destroyed and those that remain. 
 Thus, the fourfold path that has to be developed in sequence by means of the six-fold purity (chabbisuddhi)
 is called “purification by knowledge and vision” (ñāṇa- dassanavisuddhi). 
Herein, this is the section on purification. 
Doors to Emancipation	^bb#935^z3(The Three Doors to Emancipation) ^n961 Therein, the contemplation of non-self (anattānupassanā), which discards the clinging to a self, becomes the door to emancipation termed “contemplation of the void” (suññatānupassanā).
^n962 The contemplation of impermanence (aniccānupassanā), which discards the sign of perversion (vipallāsanimitta), becomes the door to emancipation termed “contemplation of the signless” (animittānupassanā).
^n963 The contemplation of suffering (sukkhānupassanā), which discards desire through craving, becomes the door to emancipation termed “contemplation of the desireless” (appaṇihitānupassanā).
^bb#936^z4(Emancipation in the Path and Fruit) ^n964 Hence, if, with insight leading to emergence, one contemplates on non-self, then, the path is known as “void (suññatā) emancipation” (vimokkha);
^n965 if one contemplates on impermanence, then, the path is known as the “signless (animitta) emancipation”;
^n966 if one contemplates on suffering, then, the path is known as the “desireless (appaṇihita) emancipation.”
 Thus, the path receives three names according to the way of insight.
 Likewise, the fruit (phala) 〔occurring〕 in the cognitive process of the path receives three names according to the way of the path. 
^bb#937^z4(Emancipation in Fruition Attainment) ^n967 However, in the cognitive process of the attainment of fruition, to those who contemplate in the foregoing manner, the fruits that arise respectively in each case are termed the “void emancipation” (suññatādivimokkha), etc., only in accordance with the way of insight.
 But, as regards objects and respective qualities, the three names are applied equally to all 〔paths and fruits〕 everywhere. 
Herein, this is the analysis of emancipation. 
Individuals	^bb#938^z3(Analysis of Individuals) ^z4(The Stream-Enterer) ^n968 Herein, having developed the path of stream-entry (sotāpattimagga), by abandon- ing wrong views (diṭṭhi) and doubt (vicikicchā), one becomes a stream-enterer (sotā- panna), one who has escaped from rebirth in woeful states and will be reborn at most seven more times (sattakkhattuparama).
^bb#939^z4(The Once-Returner) ^n969 Having developed the path of once-returning (sakadāgāmimagga), with the weakening of lust (lobha), hatred (dosa), and delusion (moha), one becomes a once- returner (sakadāgāmi), one who returns to this world only one more time. 
^bb#940^z4(The Non-Returner) ^n970 Having developed the path of non-returning (anāgāmimagga), by totally aban- doning sensual lust (kāmarāga) and ill will (vyāpāda), one becomes a non-returner (anāgāmi), one who does not return to this 〔sensory〕 state.
^bb#941^z4(The Arahant) ^n971 Having developed the path of Arahatship (arahattamagga), with the total elimina- tion of defilements (kilesa), one becomes an Arahant, a destroyer of taints, a supreme recipient of offerings in the world. 
Herein, this is the analysis of individuals. 
^bb#942^z4(Accessibility )^n972 Herein, the attainment of fruition is common to all, each being able to attain their respective fruition (phala).
^bb#943^z5(The Attainment of Cessation)^n973 But the attainment of cessation (nirodha) is accessible only to non-returners and Arahants. 
In this case, one enters successfully into the sublime attainments beginning with the first jhāna, and then, after emerging from them, one contemplates, with insight, the conditioned states (saṁkhāradhamma) within each of those attainments. 
Having proceeded, thus, up to the base of nothingness, one then attends to the preliminary duties such as the resolution, etc., and enters the base of neither-perception-nor-nonperception.
 After two occasions of javana in absorption, the continuum of consciousness is suspended.
 Then, one is said to have attained cessation (nirodha- samāpatti). 
^bb#944^z5(Emergence from Cessation) ^n974 At the time of emergence 〔from cessation〕, in the case of a non-returner, the fruit of non-returning consciousness occurs one time,
 〔while〕 in the case of an Arahant, the fruit of Arahantship consciousness 〔occurs one time〕, and then there is subsidence into the life-continuum.
 Following this, reviewing knowledge (paccavekkhaṇañāṇa) occurs. 
Herein, this is the analysis of attainments. 
The method of meditation for developing insight is finished. 
^bb#945^z3(Conclusion) ^n975 One who aspires to enjoy the taste Of practice in the Buddha’s Dispensation
 Should develop this twofold meditation So excellent in the way explained.
Thus ends the ninth chapter in the Manual of Abhidhamma entitled
“The Compendium of Meditation Subjects.”
Colophon	^z2(Colophon) This treatise — composed out of compassion for others at the request of Namba,
 a person of refined manners, belonging to a respectable family, full of faith,
 and replete with sterling virtues — has been completed.

By this great merit, may the modest monks,
 who are purified by wisdom and who shine with virtues, remember,
 till the end of the world, the most famous Mūlasoma Monastery,
 the fortunate abode, for the acquisition of merit and for their happiness.
